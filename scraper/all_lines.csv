People...did you ever hear people talking about We should go out? This is what theyre talking about...this whole thing, were all out now, no one is home. Not one person here is home, were all out! There are people tryin to find us, they dont know where we are. (on an imaginary phone) Did you ring?, I cant find him. Where did he go? He didnt tell me where he was going. He must have gone out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes, right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...Then youre standing around, whatta you do? You go: We gotta be getting back. Once youre out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right? Where ever you are in life, its my feeling, youve gotta go.",JERRY,1,1
1,"(pointing at Georges shirt) See, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot. The second button literally makes or breaks the shirt, look at it. Its too high! Its in no-mans-land. You look like you live with your mother.",JERRY,1,1
2,"You do of course try on, when you buy?",JERRY,1,1
3,"Oh, you dont recall?",JERRY,1,1
4,"Well, senator, Id just like to know, what you knew and when you knew it.",JERRY,1,1

9,"(looks in the creamer) Theres no milk in here, what...",JERRY,1,1
10,"Oh, shes really great. I mean, shes got like a real warmth about her and shes really bright and really pretty and uh... the conversation though, I mean, it was... talking with her is like talking with you, but, you know, obviously much better.",JERRY,1,1
11,"Oh, nothing happened, you know, but is was great.",JERRY,1,1
12,Yeah.,JERRY,1,1

24,"Well, look at this guy. Look, hes got everything, hes got detergents, sprays, fabric softeners.  This is not his first load.",JERRY,1,1

28,No.,JERRY,1,1

31,"This is insane. You know, I dont even know where shes staying! She, shes not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.",JERRY,1,1
32,"No no no, dont interrupt the cycle. The machine is working, it, it knows what its doing. Just let it finish.",JERRY,1,1
33,"You, you cant overdry.",JERRY,1,1
34,"Same as you cant overwet. You see, once something is wet, its wet. Same thing with death. Like once you die youre dead, right? Lets say you drop dead and I shoot you. Youre not gonna die again, youre already dead. You cant overdie, you cant overdry.",JERRY,1,1
35,How could she not tell me where she was staying?,JERRY,1,1
36,"Laundry day is the only exciting day in the life of clothes. It is...yknow, think about it. The washing machine is the nightclub of clothes. You know, its dark, theres bubbles happening, theyre all kinda dancing around in there- shirt grabs the underwear, Cmon babe, lets go. You come by, you open up the lid and theyll- (stiffens up, as the clothes) Socks are the most amazing article of clothing. They hate their lives, theyre in the shoes with stinky feet, the boring drawers. The dryer is their only chance to escape and they all know it. They knew a escape from the dryer. They plan it in the hamper the night before, Tomorrow, the dryer, Im goin. You wait here! The dryer door swings open and the sock is waiting up against the side wall. He hopes you dont see him and then he goes down the road. They get buttons sewn on their faces, join a puppet show. So theyre showing me on television the detergent for getting out bloodstains. Is this a violent image to anybody? Bloodstains? I mean, come on, you got a T-shirt with bloodstains all over it, maybe laundry isnt your biggest problem right now. You gotta get the harpoon out your chest first.",JERRY,1,1
37,"(answering, quickly) If you know what happened in the Met game, dont say anything, I taped it, hello. Yeah, no, Im sorry, you have the wrong number. Yeah, no",JERRY,1,1
38,(to the door) Yeah?,JERRY,1,1

40,"(upset) Ohhhh, what are you doing? Kessler, its a tape! I taped the game, its one oclock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night to watch this.",JERRY,1,1
41,"Meat? I dont, I dont know, go... hunt! (Kessler opens the refrigerator and sticks his head in.) Well what happened in the game anyway?",JERRY,1,1

44,"Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.",JERRY,1,1
45,"No, its okay now, that, that girl is not comin. Uh, I misread the whole thing.",JERRY,1,1
46,I dont think so.,JERRY,1,1

48,"Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.",JERRY,1,1

50,"No, its, its just my neighbour... Um... Yeah, I got it. (Jerry takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on.) Ten-fifteen... No, dont be silly, go ahead and ask... Yeah, sure... Okay, great, no no, its no trouble at all... Ill see you tomorrow... Great, bye. (He hangs up the phone; to Kessler) I dont believe it. That was her. She wants to stay here!",JERRY,1,1
51,"If my father was moving this hed had to have a cigarette in his mouth the whole way. (as his father) 'Have you got your end?...Your ends got to come down first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your ends got to come down.'",JERRY,1,1
52,"Look, its a very awkward situation. I dont wanna be presumptuous.",JERRY,1,1
53,"All right, she said she couldnt find a decent hotel room...",JERRY,1,1
54,"Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient if she stayed at my place.",JERRY,1,1
55,"(cynical) This is the signal? Thank you, Mr. Signal. Where were you yesterday?",JERRY,1,1
56,Yeah.,JERRY,1,1

58,"Yeah, okay. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I forgot to clean the bathroom.",JERRY,1,1
59,"Now, how could that be good?",JERRY,1,1
60,This is how you operate?,JERRY,1,1
61,Let me just wipe the sink.,JERRY,1,1
62,"The dating world is not a fun world...its a pressure world, its a world of tension, its a world of pain...and you know, if a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready, cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I dont know what they need. I know I dont have it, I know that- You know what they need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one Im- always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no cotton-balls, were all human beings, what is the story? Ive never had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, Ive never been in a situation, when I thought to myself: I could use a cotton-ball right now. I can certainly get out of this mess. Women need them and they dont need one or two, they need thousands of them, they need bags, theyre like peat moss bags, have you ever seen these giant bags? Theyre huge and two days later, theyre out, theyre gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, ladies? What are you doin with them? The only time I ever see em is in the bottom of your little waste basket, theres two or three, that look like theyve been through some horrible experience... tortured, interrogated, I dont know what happened to them. I once went out with a girl whos left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls over at my house. I dont know what to do with them, I took them out, I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town. Lets move on. The dating world is a world of pressure. Lets face it: a date is a job interview that lasts all night. The only difference between a date and a job interview is not many job interviews is there a chance youll end up naked at the end of it. You know? Well, Bill, the boss thinks youre the man for the position, why dont you strip down and meet some of the people youll be workin with?",JERRY,1,1
63,Wouldnt it be great if you could ask a woman what shes thinking?,JERRY,1,1
64,"You know, instead, Im like a detective. I gotta pick up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.",JERRY,1,1
65,Really? How?,JERRY,1,1
66,Uh-huh.,JERRY,1,1
67,Right.,JERRY,1,1
68,Lip area.,JERRY,1,1
69,Hug is definitely good.,JERRY,1,1
70,"Although what if its one of those hugs where the shoulders are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?",JERRY,1,1
71,You know how they do that?,JERRY,1,1
72,"Shake is bad, but what if its the two-hander? The hand on the bottom, the hand on the top, the warm look in the eyes?",JERRY,1,1
73,Right.,JERRY,1,1
74,"Hey, hey.",JERRY,1,1
75,LAURA & JERRY: Heeeey!,JERRY,1,1
76,Its good to see you.,JERRY,1,1
77,This is my friend George.,JERRY,1,1
78,This is Laura.,JERRY,1,1
79,(to Laura) I cant believe youre here.,JERRY,1,1
80,"GEORGE & JERRY: Ooh yeah, the bags, sure.",JERRY,1,1
81,"(aside, to George) Now that was an interesting greeting, did you notice that, George?",JERRY,1,1
82,"So uh, what do you think?",JERRY,1,1
83,"Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road. So uh, make yourself at home. (Laura sits down on the couch, takes off her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt.) So uh, can I get you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?",JERRY,1,1
84,"Uh, yeah, I think I do.",JERRY,1,1
85,"Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead.",JERRY,1,1
86,"Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why dont you stay? Yeah, uhm...What is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin anything?",JERRY,1,1
87,Really? What would you like to do?,JERRY,1,1
88,"(unenthusiastic) Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not. (pouring the wine) Im just, Im really glad youre here.",JERRY,1,1
89,"(answering) Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on. (to Laura) Um, its for you.",JERRY,1,1
90,(not excited) Youre engaged?,JERRY,1,1
91,Youre engaged?,JERRY,1,1
92,(matter-of-factly) Youre engaged.,JERRY,1,1
93,Yeah.,JERRY,1,1
94,Me too!,JERRY,1,1
95,"I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking. I dont get it, okay? I, I, I admit, I, Im not getting the signals. I am not getting it! Women, theyre so subtle, their little...everything they do is subtle. Men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want women, thats it! Its the only thing we know for sure, it really is. We want women. How do we get them? Oh, we dont know bout that, we dont know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites. These are the best ideas weve had so far. The car-horn honk, is that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks. E-eeehh, eehhh, eehhh! This man is out of ideas. How does it...? E-e-e-eeeehhhh! I dont think she likes me. The amazing thing is, that we still get women, dont we? Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How are men getting women, many people wonder. Let me tell you a little bit about our organization. Wherever women are, we have a man working on the situation right now. Now, he may not be our best man, okay, we have a lot of areas to cover, but someone from our staff is on the scene. Thats why, I think, men get frustrated, when we see women reading articles, like: Where to meet men? Were here, we are everywhere. Were honking our horns to serve you better.",JERRY,1,1
0,Are you through?,GEORGE,1,1
1,"Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I dont actually recall considering the buttons.",GEORGE,1,1
2,"(on an imaginary microphone) Uh, no, not at this time.",GEORGE,1,1
3,"Are, are you sure this is decaf? Wheres the orange indicator?",GEORGE,1,1
4,How come youre not doin the second show tomorrow?,GEORGE,1,1
5,"Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman is coming in?",GEORGE,1,1
6,"No, you didnt!",GEORGE,1,1
7,Ha.,GEORGE,1,1
8,"Wait wait wait, what is she... (takes the milk can from Jerry and puts it on the table) What is she like?",GEORGE,1,1
9,"(smiling) So, you know, what, what happened?",GEORGE,1,1
10,"Oh, nothing happened, but it was...",GEORGE,1,1
11,This is great!,GEORGE,1,1
12,"So, you know, she calls and says she wants to go out with you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!",GEORGE,1,1
13,"(whistles disapprovingly) Ho ho ho, Had to? Had to come in?",GEORGE,1,1
14,Had to come in and maybe well get together? Had to and maybe?,GEORGE,1,1
15,"No...no...no, I hate to tell you this. Youre not gonna see this woman.",GEORGE,1,1
16,"How do I know, maybe, you know, maybe she wanted to be polite.",GEORGE,1,1
17,"All right, all right, I didnt want to tell you this. You wanna know why she called you?",GEORGE,1,1
18,"Youre a back-up, youre a second-line, a just-in-case, a B-plan, a contingency!",GEORGE,1,1
19,"Claire, Claire, youre a woman, right?",GEORGE,1,1
20,"Uhm...Id like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical phone call, you know, from a female point of view.",GEORGE,1,1
21,"(to Claire) Now, a woman calls me, all right?",GEORGE,1,1
22,She says she has to come to New York on business...,GEORGE,1,1
23,"...and, and maybe shell see me when she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?",GEORGE,1,1
24,To be polite. I rest my case.,GEORGE,1,1
25,Im not gonna watch you do laundry.,GEORGE,1,1
26,"Come on, Im tired.",GEORGE,1,1
27,"(panicking) Right, I knew I felt something!",GEORGE,1,1
28,Jerry? I have to tell you something. This is the dullest moment Ive ever experienced.,GEORGE,1,1
29,"I need a break, Jerry, you know. I gotta get out of the city. I feel so cramped...",GEORGE,1,1
30,What?!,GEORGE,1,1
31,I cant believe- (falls on his knees) WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS!,GEORGE,1,1
32,"Cause its signals, Jerry, its signals! (snapping his fingers) Dont you- all right. Did she even ask you, what you were doin tomorrow night, if you were busy?",GEORGE,1,1
33,She calls you today and she doesnt make a plan for tomorrow? What is that? Its Saturday night!,GEORGE,1,1
34,"What is that? Its ridiculous! You dont even know what hotel shes staying at, you cant call her. Thats a signal, Jerry, thats a signal! (snaps his fingers) Signal!",GEORGE,1,1
35,Maybe Im right? Of course Im right.,GEORGE,1,1
36,"I know, I know. Listen, your stuff has to be done by now, why dont you just see if its dry?",GEORGE,1,1
37,Youre gonna overdry it.,GEORGE,1,1
38,Why not?,GEORGE,1,1
39,(to the other laundry patrons) Any questions?,GEORGE,1,1
40,Look at that. Theyre done!,GEORGE,1,1
41,"You know, I cant believe youre bringin in an extra bed for woman that wants to sleep with you. Why dont you bring in an extra guy too?",GEORGE,1,1
42,"All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What was the exact phrasing of the request?",GEORGE,1,1
43,A decent hotel-room...,GEORGE,1,1
44,"You cant be serious. This is New York city. There must be eleven million decent hotel rooms! Whatta you need? A flag? (waving his handkerchief) This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!",GEORGE,1,1
45,I think I was affected by the caffeine.,GEORGE,1,1
46,"Ho, ho, ho, good dog, good dog...",GEORGE,1,1
47,"Well, thats flattering.",GEORGE,1,1
48,"Right, can we go? Cause Im double-parked, Im gonna get a ticket.",GEORGE,1,1
49,So what? Thats good.,GEORGE,1,1
50,"Because filth is good. Whaddaya think, rock stars have sponges and ammonia lyin around the bathroom? They, have a woman comin over, Ive gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS do the opposite.",GEORGE,1,1
51,"Yeah, I wish.",GEORGE,1,1
52,Yeah.,GEORGE,1,1
53,"(feeling awkward) Its uh, not bad, its comin along. Why? Did you need something.",GEORGE,1,1
54,"Well, I might be getting into that.",GEORGE,1,1
55,"Im aware of you. (to Jerry) All right, lets go (opens the bathroom door) Lets go!",GEORGE,1,1
56,"What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman what shes thinkin.",GEORGE,1,1
57,"Listen, listen, dont get worked up, cause youre gonna know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.",GEORGE,1,1
58,Cause its all in the greeting.,GEORGE,1,1
59,"All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets you, thats a good sign.",GEORGE,1,1
60,"You know, anything in the, in the lip area is good.",GEORGE,1,1
61,You know a hug: definitely good.,GEORGE,1,1
62,Sure.,GEORGE,1,1

64,"Thats why, you know, a shake is bad.",GEORGE,1,1
65,Hand sandwich.,GEORGE,1,1
66,"I see, well, thats open to interpretation. Because so much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the eyes.",GEORGE,1,1
67,"Hi, how are you?",GEORGE,1,1
68,"Laura, sure.",GEORGE,1,1
69,"Yes, the surprise blindfold greeting. That wasnt in the manual, I dont know.",GEORGE,1,1

1,"Cheque. Now, the fact is, if its a woman in front of you thats writing the cheque, you will not be waiting long. I have noticed that women are very fast with cheques, yknow, cause they write out so many cheques. The keys, they can never find in their purse, they dont know where that is, but the cheque book: they got that. They never fumble for the cheque book. The cheque book comes out of a holster: (Jerry draws imaginary book from a holster.) Who do I make it out to? Theres my ID. Theres something about a cheque that, to a man, is not masculine. I dont know exactly what it is. I think to a man, a cheque is like a note from your mother that says, I dont have any money, but if youll contact these people, Im sure theyll stick up for me... If you just trust me this one time- I dont have any money but I have these. I wrote on these. Is this of any value at all?",JERRY,2,1
2,Whats that one?,JERRY,2,1

50,"Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic relationship, was pretty excited about it. He named it after himself. He said, Yeah, I got this new thing: Platonic. My idea, my name, callin it after myself. What I do is, I go out with the girls, I talk with them- dont do anything, and go right home. Whatd you think?

Yknow, I bet you there were guys who tried to do it, just went, Uh, Hi, uh my names Rico. Would you like to go to bed immediately? Hey, its a Riconic relationship.",JERRY,2,1
51,Hey!,JERRY,2,1

56,"No, hes making a bouillabaisse.",JERRY,2,1
57,"So, dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at these big law offices?",JERRY,2,1
58,"Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you think they would know who it was?",JERRY,2,1
59,"No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works, but I dont know her name.",JERRY,2,1
60,"Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I cant ask her.",JERRY,2,1
61,Because its complicated. Theres some tension there.,JERRY,2,1
62,"Oh yeah, shes great.",JERRY,2,1
63,"Well, its a tough thing to talk about uh. I dunno...",JERRY,2,1
64,You dont know what it was.,JERRY,2,1
65,"Well, we fight a lot for some reason.",JERRY,2,1
66,And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry.,JERRY,2,1

71,"What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasnt the one.",JERRY,2,1

117,"She knows! Oh, I am such a jackass.",JERRY,2,1
118,She knows the whole stupid thing. Vanessa and the elevator...,JERRY,2,1
119,"Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably told Elaine.",JERRY,2,1
120,Yes. Yes I am! (to Helen) What else did she say on the phone?,JERRY,2,1
121,"Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?",JERRY,2,1
122,"Yeah, but now Im nervous.",JERRY,2,1
123,Quone?,JERRY,2,1
124,"Quone? No, Im afraid that Im going to have to challenge that.",JERRY,2,1

139,"Oh, Im sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin, Artie Levine.",JERRY,2,1
140,"(sarcastically) Yeah, Levine. And Im Jerry Cougar Mellencamp. Anyway, I admit it was a fairly ridiculous thing to do, but I mean, I mean, obviously we have a little problem here.",JERRY,2,1
141,"I mean, if were gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk about other people.",JERRY,2,1

151,"Ah, high finance. Bulls, Bears, people from Conneticut.",JERRY,2,1
152,"(pause) All right, sir.",JERRY,2,1
153,Now thats not fair! So where did you meet this guy?,JERRY,2,1
154,"Uh huh. When youre on a stakeout, do you find its better to stand up against the wall, or kinda crouch down behind a big plant?",JERRY,2,1
155,"Yknow I think that even if youve had a relationship with someone, or lets say, especially if youve had a relationship with someone and you try to become friends afterwards, its very difficult. Isnt this? Its hard. Because, you know each other so well, you know all of each others tricks. Its like two magicians, trying to entertain each other. The one goes, Look, a rabbit. The other goes, So? I believe this is your card. Look, why dont we just saw each other in half and call it a night, okay?",JERRY,2,1

0,"So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this women, who felt for some reason I guess, that she thought that I cut her off. So, she pulls up along side of me, gives me the finger. It seems like such an arbitrary, ridiculous thing to just pick a finger and you show it to the person. Its a finger, what does it mean? Someone shows me one of their fingers and Im supposed to feel bad. Is that the way its supposed to work? I mean, you could just give someone the toe, really, couldnt you? I would feel worse if I got the toe, than if I got the finger. Cause its not easy to give someone the toe, youve gotta get the shoe off, the sock off and drive, get it up and... (Jerry pretends to drive with one foot in the air, giving the toe.) Look at that toe, buddy. (He puts his foot down.) I mean, thats really insulting to get the toe, isnt it?",JERRY,3,1
1,"Is that it? Got the cue tips, got the mini-umbrella, something boring to read on the plane. (Jerry zips his bag ceremoniously.) Thats it. Done!",JERRY,3,1
2,(proudly) I am...the master packer.,JERRY,3,1
3,"What you must understand, Elaine, (picking up the umbrella) packing is no different than leading men into battle. (Jerry hits his bag rhythmically with his umbrella.) Youve gotta know the strengths and weaknesses of every soldier in that platoon. From a collapsible toothbrush to a pair of ordinary black socks.",JERRY,3,1
4,Yes.,JERRY,3,1
5,"All right, sir. (He tosses Elaine his keys. The apartment buzzer goes off; Jerry presses the first button; to the intercom) George?",JERRY,3,1
6,"Uh, yeah, the, uh, hot water takes a little while to come on. So, the best thing to do is to turn it on, do all your shopping, you come back and take a shower.",JERRY,3,1
7,Theres more. The refrigerator.,JERRY,3,1
8,"Deduct a minimum of two days off all expiration dates. (He uses the umbrella to point to certain compartments in the fridge.) No meat, no leftovers, no butter. (He closes the fridge.) And I cannot overstate this: No soft cheeses of any kind. Is that clear?",JERRY,3,1
9,"One more thing, Benes, regarding sexual activity: Strictly prohibited, but if you absolutely must, do us all a big favour. Do it in the tub.",JERRY,3,1

13,How much?,JERRY,3,1
14,Two bedrooms? Why do I need two bedrooms? I got enough trouble maintaining activity in one. (George gives Elaine a look while Jerrys back is turned. Jerry turns around.) I saw that.,JERRY,3,1
15,Really? Why?,JERRY,3,1
16,Ohhhh...,JERRY,3,1
17,Like this? You just said you wanted to live here.,JERRY,3,1

19,"Elaine. (Jerry puts his bags down, sits down on the couch, picks up the remote control and points it at the spot the TV usually occupies. The TV is not there. He continues to point the remote at random things around the room, searching for the TV.) ELAINE!",JERRY,3,1

21,What?,JERRY,3,1
22,Stolen? When?,JERRY,3,1
23,Stolen?,JERRY,3,1
24,(to Kramer) You left the door open?!,JERRY,3,1
25,"Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?",JERRY,3,1
26,The door? You left the door open?,JERRY,3,1
27,"Yeah, and?",JERRY,3,1
28,So the door was wide open?,JERRY,3,1
29,(to Elaine) And where were you?,JERRY,3,1
30,No.,JERRY,3,1
31,Because I spent my money on the Clapgo D-29. Its the most impenetrable lock on the market today. It has only one design flaw. The door... (Jerry pushes the door shut.) ...MUST BE CLOSED!!,JERRY,3,1
32,"Yeah, dont investigate, dont pay me back, it was an accident.",JERRY,3,1

39,Again?,JERRY,3,1
40,(to Elaine) You would still wanna move in here?,JERRY,3,1
41,"(to George) Is that uh, other apartment still available?",JERRY,3,1
42,"I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now, the first couple a times you go through it, its very upsetting and your first reaction or one of your friends will say, Call the police. You really should call the police. So you think to yourself, you know, you watch TV, you think, Yeah, Im calling the police. Stakeouts, manhunts... Im gonna see some real action. Right, you think that. So, the police come over to your house, they fill out: The Report. They give you: Your Copy. Now, unless they give the crook his copy, I dont really think were gonna crack this case, do you? Its not like Batman, where theres three crooks in the city and everybody pretty much knows, who they are. Very few crooks even go to the trouble to come up with a theme for their careers anymore. It makes them a lot tougher to spot. Did you lose a sony? It could be the Penguin. I think we can round him up, hes dressed like a PENGUIN! We can find him, hes a PENGUIN!",JERRY,3,1

54,"Youre movin in, youre a good friend, I wanna start you off on the right foot. Give me...a hundred and fifty dollars. (Elaine is shocked, Jerry opens the door to the hall.) Get it outta here right now, take it out the door, I dont even wanna see it, go, get it out.",JERRY,3,1
55,Yeah!,JERRY,3,1
56,"Okay, you tell me. What is it worth?",JERRY,3,1
57,Yeah?,JERRY,3,1

72,Do you wanna flip a coin?,JERRY,3,1
73,"Okay, fine. (Jerry takes a coin from his pocket.) This is the official flip. No crying, no guilt, winner takes all and thats it. Agreed?",JERRY,3,1

92,"Ooh, (to Elaine) case closed!",JERRY,3,1
93,"Okay, starting...NOW!",JERRY,3,1
94,"One of the problems in life is that when youre a kid, you have a certain way of working out disagreements. And those laws do not work in the adult world. One of the main ways that kids resolve any dispute is by calling it. One of them says, I got the front seat I wanted the front seat! I called it. And the other kid knows hes got nothing to say: He called it. What can I do? If there was a Kid Court Of Law, it holds up. Your Honour, my client did ask for the front seat And the judge would go, Did he call it? Well no, he didnt call- BANG! (Jerry imitates a judge banging his gavel.) He has to call it, case closed. Objection overruled.",JERRY,3,1

9,"Uh, twice what youre payin here, but its a great building. Its two bedrooms!",GEORGE,3,1
10,"Yeah, tell im. But quickly, Im double parked here.",GEORGE,3,1
11,Lets not forget the radiator. The steam has been on here for ten years. No human can turn this off.,GEORGE,3,1
12,"Jerry, what do you, you wanna, you wanna see the place or not?",GEORGE,3,1
13,I dont know how you put up with this.,GEORGE,3,1

24,"(frantic) Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry, listen, if, if you are feeling uncomfortable about this at all, at all. Do not feel like you have to take it.",GEORGE,3,1
25,"If youre having second thoughts, if you didnt want it, dont worry about it because uh, you know, I, I...I could take it, you know.",GEORGE,3,1
26,"No, I dont want it. I want it, if you dont want it.",GEORGE,3,1
27,"No I, I want it if you dont want it.",GEORGE,3,1
28,"No, Im saying, if a situation arose in which you didnt want it, I might take it.",GEORGE,3,1
29,How can I take it?,GEORGE,3,1
30,Its your apartment!,GEORGE,3,1
31,"Yes, but I am not taking it.",GEORGE,3,1
32,"I, I dont know.",GEORGE,3,1
33,"Who flips? Youll flip, Ill call.",GEORGE,3,1

36,Flip it.,GEORGE,3,1
37,Heads!,GEORGE,3,1
38,"No, it hit the table, it hit the table.",GEORGE,3,1
39,"Interference! You cant count that! Come on, are you crazy?! The coin cannot touch anything, it affects it.",GEORGE,3,1
40,You dont have to call that! Thats a rule!,GEORGE,3,1
41,"Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it, just take it!",GEORGE,3,1

49,I love the mirror in that bathroom! I dont know what in the hell it is. I look terrific in that mirror. (George sits.) I dont know if its the tile or the lighting... I feel like Robert Wagner.,GEORGE,3,1
50,"I dont know, I cant eat. You, you cant have anything anymore. Look at this, look at this. Eggs: out. Coffee: out. French fries: out. BLT: out! I go to visit my grandparents: three big brisket sandwiches, Im sittin here with a carrot! Theyre closing in on a hundred, Im sayin to them, How can you eat that stuff? (They look at their menus again.) Im so sick about losin that choose, you dont know.",GEORGE,3,1

63,It is too!,GEORGE,3,1
64,"Hi, Carol.",GEORGE,3,1
65,Were really glad for you.,GEORGE,3,1
66,"Were aware of the proximity to the park, yes.",GEORGE,3,1
67,Nice meeting you.,GEORGE,3,1
0,(claps her hands) That is the single greatest packing performance I have ever seen.,ELAINE,3,1
1,"(laughs) Yeah, right, youre the master packer.",ELAINE,3,1
2,"(raising her hand) Scuse me, master packer...",ELAINE,3,1
3,Just gimme your keys.,ELAINE,3,1
4,"Okay, so, now, is there anything else I need to know about this place?",ELAINE,3,1
5,"Okay, this is quite a place.",ELAINE,3,1
6,Ill eat out.,ELAINE,3,1
7,Hi.,ELAINE,3,1
8,"No, Im staying here for the weekend. Im getting a break from my roommate.",ELAINE,3,1
9,"No, the waitress-actress. She just got some part in some dinner theater production of A Chorus Line. So, now all day long shes walking around the apartment singing, God, I hope I get it, I hope I get it! Shes gonna get it right in her...",ELAINE,3,1
10,Shes on the lease! George you have got to find another place for me.,ELAINE,3,1
11,You oughta at least take a look at it.,ELAINE,3,1
12,Cause then I could move in here.,ELAINE,3,1
13,Its time you got outta here anyway.,ELAINE,3,1
14,"Listen, Jerry, this place is falling apart. You have no hot water, you cant have soft cheese...",ELAINE,3,1
15,"Jerry, come on, youre doin okay now. You should at least take a look at this place. You shouldnt have to live like this.",ELAINE,3,1
16,"Well, for me its a step up. Its like moving from Iceland to Finland.",ELAINE,3,1
17,"(from the bathroom) JERRY! (Elaine enters the living-room.) Jerry, oh, hi, welcome back. How were the shows?",ELAINE,3,1
18,They were stolen.,ELAINE,3,1
19,A couple a hours ago. The police are coming right over.,ELAINE,3,1
20,(looking at Kramer) Someone left the door open.,ELAINE,3,1
21,I was at Bloomingdales... waiting for the shower to heat up.,ELAINE,3,1
22,These things happen.,ELAINE,3,1
23,Answering machine.,ELAINE,3,1
24,I didnt get that joke either.,ELAINE,3,1
25,"Yeah, tell im George.",ELAINE,3,1
26,Yes! You dont understand. Im living with Ethel Merman without the talent.,ELAINE,3,1
27,"Oh, well, come on. This is an apartment, this is a home! This is a place to live. Oooh, a fireplace, are you kidding me! Does this work?",ELAINE,3,1
28,They deliver it.,ELAINE,3,1
29,Yeah.,ELAINE,3,1
30,Look! Look at- look at this! Theres a garden.,ELAINE,3,1
31,"Yeah, you can get a gardener.",ELAINE,3,1
32,You can.,ELAINE,3,1
33,You can tip a gardener.,ELAINE,3,1
34,"Jerry, you can barbecue back here.",ELAINE,3,1
35,"Sure, its...probably the same guy, who delivers the wood.",ELAINE,3,1
36,"Oh, damn, this place is incredible, look at all this great light!",ELAINE,3,1
37,"Jerry, look at this closet! Look at this! Im walking in it! (Elaine walks into the closet.) Its a walk-in. Can you believe it? Im nuts about this, what do you think?",ELAINE,3,1
38,(laughing with joy) Your movin? That means Im movin. (She hugs Jerry.) Geeeeee (to George) isnt that incredible!,ELAINE,3,1
39,What about the couch?,ELAINE,3,1
40,What?,ELAINE,3,1
41,A hundred and fifty dollars? A hundred and fifty dollars for what? For this couch?,ELAINE,3,1
42,For this couch?!,ELAINE,3,1
43,"Okay, uh, Ill tell you what. I could go as high as uh... (She takes a closer look at couch.) I dont know, maybe...twenty dollars?",ELAINE,3,1
44,"Okay okay okay okay, you win. Forty dollars.",ELAINE,3,1
45,"Fifty dollars, okay? Fifty dollars, is that all right?",ELAINE,3,1
46,Uh-huh.,ELAINE,3,1
47,Thank you very much.,ELAINE,3,1
48,I just bought Jerrys couch for fifty dollars.,ELAINE,3,1
49,"Excuse me, uh, I dont mean to cause any trouble here, but George, if you take it, can I take your place?",ELAINE,3,1
50,"Well, one of you better damn well take it!",ELAINE,3,1
51,"I dont know, who to root for, Georges place has carpeting.",ELAINE,3,1
52,Id better not.,ELAINE,3,1
53,So what did he say?,ELAINE,3,1
54,I cant believe I lost the deposit on that U-Haul. And I threw out my couch.,ELAINE,3,1
55,My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carousel.,ELAINE,3,1
56,Couldnt be happier.,ELAINE,3,1
57,"JERRY, GEORGE & ELAINE: Whats the rent?",ELAINE,3,1
0,"Uh, Jer, well you know, I was cookin and I, I uh, I came in to get this spatula...and I left the door open, cause I was gonna bring the spatula right back!",KRAMER,3,1
1,(guiltily) The door.,KRAMER,3,1
2,"Yeah, well, I was gonna bring the spatula right back.",KRAMER,3,1
3,"Well, I got caught up... watching a soap opera. The Bold And The Beautiful.",KRAMER,3,1
4,Wide open!,KRAMER,3,1
5,"Look, Jerry, Im sorry, Im uh- you have insurance, right buddy?",KRAMER,3,1
6,(shocked) How can you not have insurance?,KRAMER,3,1
7,"Jerry! Im gonna find your stuff. Im gonna solve it, Im on the case, buddy, Im on the case.",KRAMER,3,1
8,(theatrical) I made a mistake.,KRAMER,3,1
9,Im human.,KRAMER,3,1
10,"Jerry, I think Im on to something. I think I found your stuff. You know the Englishman who lives down the hall?",KRAMER,3,1
11,The last couple a days hes been acting very strange. I think hes avoiding me.,KRAMER,3,1
12,"Yeah! And get this: I just got off the elevator with him and I tested him, I tested him, like I...this is what I said to him, like I, I was like this, I went, Oh, by the way, I know about the stuff.",KRAMER,3,1
13,"..you know, very casually,",KRAMER,3,1
14,(cont'd) so that he was gonna take me into his confidence.,KRAMER,3,1
15,What stuff?,KRAMER,3,1
16,"No, you dont understand, you see, he swallowed. See, the guy, he swallowed. Oh, he was nervous about something! Now, Im gonna go over there, Im gonna borrow some tea. If I dont get back in five minutes, maybe youd better call the police.",KRAMER,3,1
17,Yeah!,KRAMER,3,1
0,"Most men like working on things. Tools, objects, fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed a guys out in his driveway working on something with tools, how all the other men in the neighborhood are magnetically drawn to this activity. They just come wandering out of the house like zombies. Men, its true, men hear a drill, its like a dog whistle. Just... (his head perks up) you know, they go running up to that living room curtain, Honey, I think Jims working on something over there. So they run over to the guy. Now they dont actually help the guy. No, they just want to hang around the area where work is being done. Thats what men want to do. We want to watch the guy, we want to talk to him, we want to ask him dumb questions. You know, What are you using, a Phillips-head? You know, we feel involved. Thats why when they have construction sites, they have to have those wood panel fences around it, thats just to keep the men out. They cut those little holes for us so we can see what the hell is going on. But if they dont cut those holes, we are climbing those fences. Right over there. What are you using the steel girders down there? Yeah, thatll hold.",JERRY,4,1
1,I dont think you did anything wrong.,JERRY,4,1
2,We can only thank God for that.,JERRY,4,1
3,Youre imagining this. Really.,JERRY,4,1
4,What floss? When?,JERRY,4,1
5,"Ah, mint.",JERRY,4,1
6,"So let me get this straight. She saw the floss, you panicked and you told her you liked her.",JERRY,4,1
7,And youre sure the floss was the catalyst?,JERRY,4,1
8,You dont think it mightve had anything to do with that?,JERRY,4,1
9,It looks like your belt is digesting a small animal.,JERRY,4,1
10,(to Kramer) Who is it?,JERRY,4,1
11,Who is it?,JERRY,4,1
12,"(to the phone) Hello? (disappointed) Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits Kramer with a magazine.) No. Uh, I was out of town. I just got back. Kramer doesnt know anything. Hes just my next-door neighbor. Uh, nothing much... Tuesday? Uh, Tuesday, no. Im meeting somebody... Uh, Wednesday? Wednesdays okay... All right. Uh, Im a little busy right now. Can we talk Wednesday morning?... Okay... Yeah... Right... Thanks... Bye. (Jerry hangs up; to Kramer) Why did you put me on the phone with him? I hate just being handed a phone.",JERRY,4,1
13,Maybe I didnt want to talk to him.,JERRY,4,1
14,He bothers me. I dont even answer the phone anymore because of him. Hes turned me into a screener. Now I gotta go see him on Wednesday.,JERRY,4,1
15,Were going. Thats next Wednesday.,JERRY,4,1
16,His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We were friends. Should I suffer the rest of my life because I like to play Ping Pong? I was ten. I wouldve been friends with Stalin if he had a Ping Pong table. Hes so self-involved.,JERRY,4,1
17,Can you conduct your business elsewhere?,JERRY,4,1
18,I dont bother with him. Hes been calling me for seven years. Ive never called him once! Hes got the attention span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit there and I make up things just to see if hes paying attention.,JERRY,4,1
19,"What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him, I dont think were right for each other. Hes a guy! At least with a woman, theres a precendent. You know, the relationship goes sour, you end it.",JERRY,4,1
20,Just break up with him?,JERRY,4,1
21,The Truth.,JERRY,4,1
22,"As a guy I dont know how I can break up with another guy. You know what I mean? I dont know how to say, Bill, I feel I need to see other men. Do you know what I mean? Theres nothing I can do. I have to wait for someone to die. I think thats the only way out of this relationship. It could be a long time. See, the great thing about guys is that we can become friends based on almost nothing. Just two guys will just become friends just because theyre two guys. Thats almost all we need to have in common. Cause sports  sports and women  is really all we talk about. If there was no sports and no women the only thing guys would ever say is, So, whats in the refrigerator?",JERRY,4,1
23,"You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography, I thought it was really... interesting. He would-",JERRY,4,1
24,"(testing Joel) So, Im thinking about going to Iran this summer.",JERRY,4,1
25,"Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform. (Joel shakes his head agreeing; Jerry smiles) You know, its their annual terrorist luncheon.",JERRY,4,1
26,(cont'd) Im gonna do it in Farsi.,JERRY,4,1
27,"Yeah, Ill have the egg salad on whole wheat.",JERRY,4,1
28,How can you talk to someone like that?,JERRY,4,1
29,"Listen, Joel. Theres something I have to tell you...",JERRY,4,1
30,"Listen, Joel, I dont think we should see each other anymore.",JERRY,4,1
31,This friendship: Its not working.,JERRY,4,1
32,Were just not suited to be friends.,JERRY,4,1
33,"Look, youre a nice guy, its just that... we dont have anything in common.",JERRY,4,1
34,"Y-You didnt do anything. Its not you, its me. Its- this is very difficult.",JERRY,4,1
35,"No, its not that.",JERRY,4,1
36,"Oh, come on. Thats not true.",JERRY,4,1
37,"I know, I know.",JERRY,4,1
38,Best friend- Ive never been to your apartment.,JERRY,4,1
39,"Okay, okay. Forget it. Its okay. I didnt mean it.",JERRY,4,1
40,What I said. Ive been under a lot of stress.,JERRY,4,1
41,"Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever happend? Im sorry. I didnt mean it. I took it out on you. Were still friends. Were still friends. Still friends. Okay? Look, Ill tell you what. Ive got Knick tickets this Wednesday. Great seats behind the bench. You want to come with me? Come on.",JERRY,4,1
42,"No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I wouldve said tonight.",JERRY,4,1
43,(lying) Yes.,JERRY,4,1
44,Next Wednesday.,JERRY,4,1
45,Yeah.,JERRY,4,1
46,"Ugh, the four worst words in the English language.",JERRY,4,1
47,That is worse.,JERRY,4,1
48,Really.,JERRY,4,1
49,Hm. You ate.,JERRY,4,1
50,"Someone says, Get out of my life, and that doesnt affect your appetite?",JERRY,4,1
51,It is unbelievable.,JERRY,4,1
52,How much could you possibly have in there?,JERRY,4,1
53,"Yeah? Whered he go, to an arcade?",JERRY,4,1
54,"Cmon, move up.",JERRY,4,1
55,"Oh, God.",JERRY,4,1
56,"Listen, George, little problem with the game.",JERRY,4,1
57,"The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..",JERRY,4,1
58,I gave your ticket to Horneck.,JERRY,4,1
59,"Yeah, Im sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.",JERRY,4,1
60,"Cmon, cmon, go ahead, move up.",JERRY,4,1
61,You didnt see him. It was horrible.,JERRY,4,1
62,I had to do it.,JERRY,4,1
63,Do you want to go with him? You go. I dont mind.,JERRY,4,1
64,"No, I do not like the bank. Ive heard the expression Laughing all the way to the bank. I have never seen anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate it when theres nobody on the line at all, you know that part, you go to the bank, its empty and you still have to go through the little maze. (walking on the stage like he is going through a maze) Can you get a little piece of cheese for me? Im almost at the front. Id like a reward for this please.",JERRY,4,1
65,George.,JERRY,4,1
66,Could you stop the counting?,JERRY,4,1
67,Can I make it up to you? Ill give you fifty bucks for the jug.,JERRY,4,1
68,"Well, then Im not going to the game either. Okay? Ill give him both tickets.",JERRY,4,1
69,"I- no, I dont want to go.",JERRY,4,1
70,"I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me call his machine now and Ill just make up some excuse why I cant go to the game either.",JERRY,4,1
71,"George, the man wept.",JERRY,4,1
72,"I-I have to say something. With all due respect, I just never- I cant imagine anyone in any walk of life, under any circumstance, wanting to make their own pizza pie... but thats me. Alright",JERRY,4,1
73,Im just saying..Alright.,JERRY,4,1
74,Okay.,JERRY,4,1
75,"(to the phone) Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this before you- Oh, Hi. Joel... Oh, you just came in... Listen, I cant make it to the game tonight... I, uh, have to tutor my nephew... Yeah, hes got an exam tomorrow... Geometry... You know, trapezoids, rhombus... Anyway, listen, you take the tickets. Theyre at the Will-Call window... And Im really sorry... Have a good time... Well talk next week... Okay... Yeah, I dont... Fine.. Fine... Bye.",JERRY,4,1
76,I know. Im really running out of excuses with this guy. I need some kind of excuse rolodex.,JERRY,4,1
77,Okay.,JERRY,4,1
78,Where do you want to go?,JERRY,4,1
79,We could go to one of those uh cappuccino places. They let you just sit there.,JERRY,4,1
80,We could talk.,JERRY,4,1
81,Then well just sit there.,JERRY,4,1
82,"Okay, just hand that over, please.",JERRY,4,1
83,"Its a list of excuses, its for that guy, Horneck, whos at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and I dont have to see him. (Elaine laughs.) I need it. (Elaine starts writing on the list.) What are you doing?",JERRY,4,1
84,I dont need any more.,JERRY,4,1
85,(not amused) Very funny.,JERRY,4,1
86,"Im Dan. Can I have my list back, please?",JERRY,4,1
87,What can I do?,JERRY,4,1
88,Oh no. Thats impossible. Id rather lie to him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying. Tears. Accompanied by mucus.,JERRY,4,1
89,Couple of tough monkeys.,JERRY,4,1
90,Game?,JERRY,4,1
91,Wait. How does Horneck know you?,JERRY,4,1
92,This is too much.,JERRY,4,1
93,"Oh, no.",JERRY,4,1
94,Perfect.,JERRY,4,1
95,"Oh, we finished early.",JERRY,4,1
96,"Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.",JERRY,4,1
97,Were still friends.,JERRY,4,1
98,Right. I forgot about choir.,JERRY,4,1
99,"Right. You know, the Wall being down and everything.",JERRY,4,1
100,You really should.,JERRY,4,1
101,"You know, I really... Ive come to the conclusion that there are certain friends in your life that theyre just always your friends, and you have to accept it. You see them, you dont really wanna see them. You dont call them, they call you. You dont call back, they call again. The only way to get through talking with people that you dont really have anything in common with is to pretend youre hosting your own little talk show. This is what I do. You pretend theres a little desk around you. The only problem with this is theres no way you can say, Hey, its been great having you on the show. Were out of time.",JERRY,4,1
0,I had to say something. (chuckles) I had to say something. Everything was going so well. I had to say something.,GEORGE,4,1
1,I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I feel. I like you I dont tell you.,GEORGE,4,1
2,Im outta the picture. I am outta the picture. (laughs) Its only a matter of time now.,GEORGE,4,1
3,"Oh, no. No no no no.",GEORGE,4,1
4,Ill tell you when it happened. When that floss came flying out of my pocket.,GEORGE,4,1
5,"We were in the lobby during the intermission of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange drink, for five dollars. I reached into my pocket to pay for it, I looked down; theres this piece of green floss hanging from my fingers.",GEORGE,4,1
6,"Of course. So, Im looking at it. I look up, I see shes looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment. I just..",GEORGE,4,1
7,"If I didnt put that floss in my pocket, Id be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.",GEORGE,4,1

9,What? You dont like this?,GEORGE,4,1
10,What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench! What happened? Were not going?,GEORGE,4,1
11,Oh. Who is this guy?,GEORGE,4,1
12,"I dont know why you even bother with this ping pong guy, Ill tell you that.",GEORGE,4,1
13,I dont understand why you spend time with this guy.,GEORGE,4,1
14,"No no no no, you have to approach this as if he was a woman.",GEORGE,4,1
15,Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.,GEORGE,4,1
16,...she calls me up at my office,GEORGE,4,1
17,"(cont'd) she says, We have to talk.",GEORGE,4,1
18,"That, or Whos bra is this?",GEORGE,4,1
19,"So we order lunch, and were talking. Finally, she blurts out how its not working.",GEORGE,4,1
20,"So, Im thinking, as shes saying this, Im thinking: great, the relationships over. But the egg salads on the way. So now I have a decision: Do I walk or do I eat?",GEORGE,4,1
21,"We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing, staring at each other in a defunct relationship.",GEORGE,4,1
22,Have you ever had their egg salad?,GEORGE,4,1
23,Its unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable? I picked up the check. She didnt even offer. She ended it. The least she could do is send me off with a sandwich.,GEORGE,4,1
24,Its my money. What should I do? Throw it out the window? I know a guy who took his vacation on his change.,GEORGE,4,1
25,(sarcastically) Thats funny. Youre a funny guy.,GEORGE,4,1
26,Ewings hurt? How long is he going to be out?,GEORGE,4,1
27,Geez.,GEORGE,4,1
28,I got scared there for a second. The Knicks without Ewing.,GEORGE,4,1
29,What about it?,GEORGE,4,1
30,What?,GEORGE,4,1
31,(not believing him) You what?!,GEORGE,4,1
32,No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?,GEORGE,4,1

34,"Oh, cmon, Jerry. I cant believe this.",GEORGE,4,1
35,"Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change this into bills?",GEORGE,4,1
36,"Im not going with him. I dont even know the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.",GEORGE,4,1
37,"You want me to roll six thousand of these?! What, should I quit my job?!",GEORGE,4,1
38,"...thirty-two, thirty-three-",GEORGE,4,1

42,"Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.",GEORGE,4,1
43,"Oh geeeee. (George pantomimes sticking a knife in his heart, and twists it.) Go, go!",GEORGE,4,1
44,He was really crying?,GEORGE,4,1
45,"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as youre going to lie to the guy, why dont you tell him that you lost both of the tickets, then we can go?",GEORGE,4,1
46,This is the thing where you go and you have to make your own pizza?,GEORGE,4,1
47,"You know, you have to know how to do that. You cant have people shoving their arms into a six-hundred degree oven!",GEORGE,4,1
48,"Oh, well...",GEORGE,4,1
49,My moneys all tied up in change right now.,GEORGE,4,1
50,Trapezoid?,GEORGE,4,1

4,Ill go if I dont have to talk.,ELAINE,4,1

11,Deal with it. Be a man!,ELAINE,4,1
12,You made a man cry? Ive never made a man cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didnt cry. I got the cab.,ELAINE,4,1
13,"Wait, what pizza place idea?",ELAINE,4,1
14,"Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would be fun.",ELAINE,4,1
15,JERRY & ELAINE: No thanks.,ELAINE,4,1
16,Hi.,ELAINE,4,1
17,"Oh, no no. Tuesdays uh no good becasue weve got choir practice.",ELAINE,4,1
18,We-Were doing that evening of Eastern European National Anthems.,ELAINE,4,1
19,Huh... Thursday is no good because weve got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.,ELAINE,4,1
0,"(to the phone) Oh, theyve got a cure for cancer. See, its all big business. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (to the phone again) Yeah yeah yeah yeah take my number. 555-8643. Okay, here he is.",KRAMER,4,1

4,"Well, why not?",KRAMER,4,1
5,"Thats for me. (to the phone) Kramerica Industries. Oh, hi, Mark. No no no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza place where you make your own pie...",KRAMER,4,1
6,(ignoring Jerry) No no no. Im talking about a whole chain of em. Yeah.,KRAMER,4,1
7,"Oh, hey guys. Man, Im telling you, this pizza idea, is really going to happen.",KRAMER,4,1
8,"Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it, you pound it, you fling it in the air. And then you get to put your sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese, and then- you slide it into the oven.",KRAMER,4,1
9,Its all supervised.,KRAMER,4,1
10,All of it. You want to invest?,KRAMER,4,1
11,"No, Im tellin you, people, they really want to make their own pizza pie.",KRAMER,4,1

15,"One day, youll beg me to make your own pie.",KRAMER,4,1
16,"Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed a great game tonight, buddy!",KRAMER,4,1
17,Knick game. Horneck took me. We were sitting two rows behind the bench. We're getting hit by sweat!,KRAMER,4,1

23,(to Joel) Its gonna be hot in a minute.,KRAMER,4,1
0,"Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end of the meal system, because moneys a very different thing before and after you eat. Before you eat, money has no value. And you dont care about money when youre hungry. You sit down at a restaurant, youre like the ruler of an empire. More drinks, appetizers, quickly, quickly! It will be the greatest meal of our lives. Then after the meal, you know, youve got the pants open, youve got the napkins destroyed, cigarette butt in the mashed potatoes. Then the check comes at that moment. People are always upset, you know. Theyre mystified by the check. What is this? How could this be? They start passing it around the table, Does this look right to you? Were not hungry now. Why are we buying all this food?",JERRY,5,1

11,Maybe.,JERRY,5,1
12,How highs it suppose to go?,JERRY,5,1

18,All right. Twenty-five hundred.,JERRY,5,1
19,My bet? All right. Ill open with a tuna sandwich.,JERRY,5,1

23,"I have to say, those people talking behind us really ruined that movie for me.",JERRY,5,1
24,"What do you want me to do? I gave the guy the half-turn. (acts like he did in the movie) Then I gave him the full-turn with the eye roll. (does the next look) I mean, beyond that, Im risking a punch in the mouth. (To a stock boy) Excuse me, do you have these in the puffs?",JERRY,5,1
25,"You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.",JERRY,5,1
26,Its great! It speeds up the intimacy level. Its like putting the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months from now we accomplish (snaps his fingers) three days.,JERRY,5,1
27,"Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased phone call frequency, walking around naked. You know, the presents get a lot better in Phase Two.",JERRY,5,1

29,"Oh, big fighting marlin. (Jerry acts like he is catching a marlin)",JERRY,5,1

46,"Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?",JERRY,5,1
47,"Well, this is it. Im selling.",JERRY,5,1

53,Who goes to the hospital to rest?,JERRY,5,1
54,"Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?",JERRY,5,1
55,All right.,JERRY,5,1
56,Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. Its completely shrunk. Theres absolutely no way I can wear it.,JERRY,5,1
57,Whats the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of this shirt?!,JERRY,5,1
58,I cant find the receipt.,JERRY,5,1
59,"Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had the receipt- look at it! Its a hand puppet. What am I gonna do with this?!",JERRY,5,1
60,"What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money? In fact, forget the money. I dont even want the money. I just once, I would like to hear a dry cleaner admit that something was their fault. Thats what I want. I want an admission of guilt.",JERRY,5,1
61,No! Dry-cleaned.,JERRY,5,1
62,You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just tell me that you shrunk it!,JERRY,5,1
63,"I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I can say to the dry cleaner, Well, its ruined. And of course, the dry cleaner can respond, Its not our fault. Were not responsible. We just ruin the clothes. That ends our legal obligation. You see, the whole problem with dry cleaning is that we all believe that this is actually possible. Th-Right? Theyre cleaning our clothes, but theyre not getting anything wet. Its all dry. I know theres gotta be some liquids back there, some fluids that theyre using. Theres no such thing as dry cleaning. When you get something on your shirt, ever get something on your shirt and try to get it off like that (Jerry brushes off his shirt.) Thats dry cleaning. I dont think thats what theyre doing back there. They dont have eighty guys going, Come on, hurry up! Theres a lot of shirts today!",JERRY,5,1
64,Bless you.,JERRY,5,1
65,"Well, it couldnt be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks a cat?",JERRY,5,1

70,I dont know.. fifteen hundred dollars.,JERRY,5,1
71,"You dont have to say Wow. I know its Wow. (Kramer smiling) And theres that smile again. Well, what is that? (Intercom buzzes.) Its George.",JERRY,5,1
72,I really dont need to look.,JERRY,5,1
73,"Yeah, and youre just what shes looking for too  a stranger leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.",JERRY,5,1
74,What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods.) Did he tell you whats gonna happen? (George shakes his head.) How long were you there?,JERRY,5,1
75,You told him you knew Simons?,JERRY,5,1
76,"Well, thats it. Look, Im going to Vermont. I dont want to think about this. Im selling.",JERRY,5,1
77,So I know this guy. Im getting all my sneakers at a discount now.,JERRY,5,1
78,"Oh yeah, right.",JERRY,5,1
79,(thinking) Oh God. Get me out of here. What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And Ive still got another day! Ive got nothing left to say. Wait... wait... Got one. (to Vanessa) Thats a nice watch. Do you wind it?,JERRY,5,1
80,"Well, thats good.",JERRY,5,1
81,"(thinking) Well, the drive home should be a delight. Im speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail. I dont care. (to Vanessa) That's the manager? Do you want me to see if we can get another room?",JERRY,5,1
82,"So, I guess you dont find the separate faucets for the hot and cold, charming?",JERRY,5,1
83,"Well, what do you want to do this afternoon?",JERRY,5,1
84,We cold play Sorry! We cold play Steal the Old Mans Bundle. (Vanessa not amused; Jerry thinking) Maybe I can get an extension cord and hang myself. (to Vanessa) What kind of perfume is that youre wearing?,JERRY,5,1
85,"No, what? What kind is it?",JERRY,5,1
86,"(thinking) Yeah, thats normal. (to a man nearby) Excuse me, sir. Could I have a look at that business section?",JERRY,5,1
87,I did. Im just curious. Its been almost a week. I want to check it out. (He finds the stock.) Six points? (to Vanessa) Its up six points!,JERRY,5,1
88,You did not tell me not to sell.,JERRY,5,1
89,"Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!",JERRY,5,1
90,What?,JERRY,5,1
91,"No, what? Thats probably why..",JERRY,5,1
92,"(thinking) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty-nine hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the name of that perfume...",JERRY,5,1
93,"(acidly) Shes full. So, Big Daddy. Im just curious. How much did you clear on your little transaction there, all told?",JERRY,5,1
94,How much?,JERRY,5,1
95,"So, Wilkinsons out of the hospital now?",JERRY,5,1
96,Is that still from the cats?,JERRY,5,1
97,"So, what ever happened with that?",JERRY,5,1
98,"I gotta say, thats pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.",JERRY,5,1
99,We went over that.,JERRY,5,1
100,A robot butcher?,JERRY,5,1
101,"Im not an investor. People always tell me, you should have your money working for you. Ive decided Ill do the work. Im gonna let the money relax. You know what I mean? Cause you send your money out there  working for you  a lot of times, it gets fired. You go back there, What happened? I had my money. It was here, it was working for me. Yeah, I remember your money. Showing up late. Taking time off. We had to let him go.",JERRY,5,1
0,I never heard him say anything really funny.,GEORGE,5,1
1,"You would think that, but either youre born with a sense of humor, or youre not. Its not going to change even if you go from the red sun of Krypton all the way to the yellow sun of the Earth.",GEORGE,5,1
2,I dont know. But he aint funny.,GEORGE,5,1
3,Pardon?,GEORGE,5,1
4,Guys with cats... I dont know.,GEORGE,5,1
5,"Oh, no. No no no no no. Id have to advise against that. What, do you know this woman a month? Lets see, youre going to be with her seventy-two hours. Thats a dating decathlon.",GEORGE,5,1
6,"Thats exquisite. Listen, uh, if its not too much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?",GEORGE,5,1
7,Up again?! This is incredible! Im.. Im getting it.,GEORGE,5,1
8,A stock.,GEORGE,5,1
9,"Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?",GEORGE,5,1
10,"He knows this guy, Wilkinson. He made a fortune in the stock market. Now hes got some new thing. You know, theres supposed to be a big merger. He wasnt even supposed to say anything. You guys should think about doing this too.",GEORGE,5,1
11,"I dont know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved, that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You wanna do it?",GEORGE,5,1
12,Its called Sendrax. Theyve got some new kind of technique for televising opera.,GEORGE,5,1
13,Some sort of electronic thingy.,GEORGE,5,1
14,Five thousand... Ten. Ten thousand. Five thousand.,GEORGE,5,1
15,Cmon. Wilkinsons got millions invested in this stock. Its gone up three points since Ive been watching it.,GEORGE,5,1
16,"Cmon, go for twenty-five hundred. Well do it together. Come on, come on. Were in it together.",GEORGE,5,1
17,Thats it.,GEORGE,5,1
18,(Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.,GEORGE,5,1
19,Ill have the tuna.,GEORGE,5,1
20,All Simons was able to find out is that hes in the hospital.,GEORGE,5,1
21,"Of course hes been in touch with him. Hes left two messages. He just hasnt heard back yet, thats all.",GEORGE,5,1
22,Just give it a little more time.,GEORGE,5,1
23,"All right, all right. Thats it. Im gonna go down there.",GEORGE,5,1
24,To the hospital.,GEORGE,5,1
25,Im going to find out whats going on. All right?,GEORGE,5,1
26,"So what? Ill start talking to him, you know, casual, and Ill work my way around to it.",GEORGE,5,1
27,Maybe hes resting.,GEORGE,5,1
28,"What are you, a doctor?",GEORGE,5,1
29,Today. Im going today. Just dont do anything until you hear from me.,GEORGE,5,1
30,"(to the woman) Boy, I have to get to a bathroom.",GEORGE,5,1
31,Fifteen seconds.,GEORGE,5,1
32,"Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know, Im in the parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. Ill tell you one thing. I dont know what hes got. But for a sick guy, hes very strong.",GEORGE,5,1
33,(laughs) Not quite.,GEORGE,5,1
34,Im keeping it. Im going down with the ship.,GEORGE,5,1
35,"(laughing) Have something else. Cmon, have a little dessert?",GEORGE,5,1
36,"Elaine, get something! Its all taken care of.",GEORGE,5,1
37,So dont finish it.,GEORGE,5,1
38,I dont like to discuss figures.,GEORGE,5,1
39,"I dont know, what? Eight thousand. Its a Hyundai. Get out of here. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson cleaned up.",GEORGE,5,1
40,He chose the cats?,GEORGE,5,1
41,"I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad you cant get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super speed and reverse time. Youd get all the money back, you could have avoided the whole trip to Vermont...",GEORGE,5,1
42,"Pst. (moves in close with Elaine and Jerry) Wilkinsons got a bite on a new one. Petramco Corp. Out of, uh Springfield. I think. Theyre about to introduce some sort of a robot butcher.",GEORGE,5,1
43,"Shhhhh. If you want to get in, theres very little time. (calling to the waitress) Sweetheart.. (Waitress approaches and tears off a check. George stops her.) No, no, no. That ought to cover it. (He hands her some money; she turns to leave; George stops her.) Just a second. Just a... let me jus-peek... (He looks at the check, then takes some money out of her hand. George urges Jerry and Elaine to eat.) Come on, come on, come on...",GEORGE,5,1
0,"I know, I know. Im sorry Im late.",ELAINE,5,1
1,I dropped a grape.,ELAINE,5,1
2,"I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I couldnt find it. I was, I was literally on my knees for ten minutes looking for this stupid grape. I have no idea where it went.",ELAINE,5,1
3,"No, Im just getting over an allergy attack. This guy Im going out with...",ELAINE,5,1
4,"Robert. Yes. Thank you. He has two cats and Im allergic to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I cant even go into his apartment, you know. And, of course, my apartment is the actors studio so we cant go there. Its really causing a lot of problems, you know. He wont even go away for the weekend because of these cats.",ELAINE,5,1
5,Vanessa.,ELAINE,5,1
6,"(balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why dont you take her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know, that really charming place with the separate faucets for the hot and cold. Shell love it.",ELAINE,5,1
7,Youre getting what?,ELAINE,5,1
8,Id do it but I dont have any money.,ELAINE,5,1
9,Televising opera?,ELAINE,5,1
10,Tuna?,ELAINE,5,1
11,Theyre dying in the nets.,ELAINE,5,1
12,"Jerry, cant you incorporate one unselfish act in your daily routine?",ELAINE,5,1
13,And Im going to have an English muffin with margarine on the side and a cup of coffee.,ELAINE,5,1

You know, youre thinking about about them. Things like, I wonder what hes got. As soon as she goes, Im getting her magazine. And then, they finally call you and its a very exciting moment.

Ill see you all later. You know, so you think youre going to see the doctor, but youre not, are you? No. Youre going into the next waiting room  the littler waiting room.

You know what I mean? You ever see these operating theaters, that they have, with like, stadium seating? You dont want them doing anything to you that makes other doctors go, I have to see this!

Youre doing it! And then she started to cry, and I weakened a bit. I almost relented, but the voice, Jerry, the voice said, Keep going, keep going. Youre almost out! Its like I was making a prison break, you know, and Im heading for the wall, and I trip and I twist my ankle, and they throw the light on you, you know. So, somehow I get though the crying and I keep running. Then the cursing started. Shes firing at me from the guard tower. Son of a bang!

8,"Tell me if you think this is strange. Theres this guy who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years ago by a friend. Hes a uh teacher, or something. Anyway, after we met, whenever wed run into each other on the street, or in the lobby, or whatever, we would stop and we would chat a little. Nothing much. Little pleasantries. Hes a nice guy, hes got a family. Then after a while, I noticed there was not more stopping. Just saying hello and continuing on our way. And then the verbal hellos stopped, and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition. So, fine. I figure, thats where this relationship is finally gonna settle: polite nodding. Then one day, he doesnt nod. Like I dont exist?! He went from nods to nothing.",ELAINE,6,2

17,Yes.,ELAINE,6,2
18,"Yes. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was just going to walk on by, but then I thought, No no no. No. Do not be afraid of this man.",ELAINE,6,2
19,"So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder. And I said, Hi, remember me? And he furrows his brow, as if hes really trying to figure it out. So I said to him, I said, You little phony. You know exactly who I am.",ELAINE,6,2
20,"I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, Oh, yeah. Youre Jeanettes friend. We did meet once. And I said, Well, how do you go from that to totally ignoring a person when they walk by?",ELAINE,6,2
21,"And he says, he says, Look, I just didnt want to say hello anymore, All right? And I said, Fine. Fine. I didnt want to say hello anymore either, but just I wanted you to know that Im aware of it!",ELAINE,6,2

32,Youre his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone else? Some jerk that he doesnt even know?,KRAMER,6,2

0,"My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year. They didnt want to move to Florida, but theyre in their sixties, and thats the law. You know how it works. They got the leisure police. They pull up in front of the old peoples house with a golf cart, jump out, Lets go Pop, white belt, white pants, white shoes, get in the back. Drop the snow shovel right there. Drop it! I am not much for the family gathering. You know, you sit there, and the conversations so boring. Its so dull. And you start to fantasize. You know, you think, What if I just got up and jumped out that window? What would it be like? Just crashed right through the glass. You know. Come back in, theres broken glass, everybodys all upset. No, Im all right. I was just a little bored there. And uh no, Im fine. I came back.

35,"No, see, we didnt have ponies. Im sure at that time in Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..",JERRY,7,2
36,"I didnt know she had a pony. How was I to know she had a pony? Who figures an immigrants going to have a pony? Do you know what the odds are on that? I mean, in all the pictures I saw of immigrants on boats coming into New York harbor, I never saw one of them sittin on a pony. Why would anybody come here if they had a pony?

54,You dont think that I killed her?,JERRY,7,2
55,It was just an innocent comment! I didnt know she had a pony!,JERRY,7,2

58,Ah,JERRY,7,2
59,Ive got the softball game on Wednesday. Its the championship.,JERRY,7,2

63,I dont know what to do.,JERRY,7,2
64,"We dont understand death. And the proof of this is that we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I think if you cant stretch out and get some solid rest at that point, I dont see how bedding accessories really make the difference. I mean, they got the guy in a suit with a pillow. Now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching forty winks? I mean, lets make up our mind where we think theyre going.",JERRY,7,2

83,"Oh, well, of course. Nineteen-seventy-three.",JERRY,7,2
84,Wonder about what?,JERRY,7,2
85,You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex on me?,JERRY,7,2
86,But I went to the funeral.,JERRY,7,2
87,Dont you think she woulda heard I was there?,JERRY,7,2
88,Who figures and immigrants gonna have a pony?,JERRY,7,2
89,"What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides the pony ride. Why ponies? What are we doing with them?

Yeah, Im talking to you. Behind the barricades! So somebody, I assume, genetically engineered these ponies. Do you think they could make them any size? I mean, could they make them like the size of a quarter, if they wanted? That would be fun for Monopoly, though, wouldnt it?

3,(to Jerry) Whos going to play left field?,GEORGE,7,2
4,"Bender? He cant play left. He stinks. I just dont see what purpose is it gonna serve your going? I mean, you think dead peole care whos at their funeral? They dont even know theyre having a funeral. Its not like shes hanging out in the back going, I cant believe Jerry didnt show up.",GEORGE,7,2

8,"And then in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the pop fly?",GEORGE,7,2

5,"Really? (Jerry nods his head) Well, what if it doesnt stop? Oh, that I really needed to hear. That helps a lot! All right, just say something. Just start talking. Change the subject. Lets just go, All right? I cant believe were having dinner with Alton Benes.",GEORGE,8,2

7,(singing) : Master of the house/Keeper of the inn... (Jerry re-enters the living room and modestly models his new jacket for George. George is impressed.) This is huge! When did this happen?,GEORGE,8,2
8,Can I say one thing to you? And I say this with an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.,GEORGE,8,2
9,Its fabulous.,GEORGE,8,2
10,"And Ill tell you something else, Im not even going to ask you. I want to know. But Im not gonna ask. Youll tell me when you feel comfortable. So what was it? Four hundred? Five hundred? Did you pay five hundred for this? (Jerry coyly ignores Georges questions, while George grows increasingly serious.) Over six? Cant be seven. Dont tell me you paid seven hundred dollars for this jacket! Did you pay seven hundred dollars for this jacket? Is that what youre saying to me? You are sick! Is that what you paid for this jacket? Over seven hundred? What did you pay for this jacket?! I wont say anything. I wanna know what you paid for this jacket! Oh my God! A thousand dollars?! You paid a thousand dollars for this jacket?! All right, fine. (George heads for the door.) Im walking outta here right now thinking you paid a thousand dollars for this jacket, unless you tell me different. (Jerry remains silent.) Oh, ho! All right! Ill tell you what, if you dont say anything in the next five seconds, Ill know it was over a thousand.",GEORGE,8,2

12,(singing) Master of the House/Quick to catch your eye/Never wants a passerby to pass him by...,GEORGE,8,2
13,Maybe he didnt show up.,GEORGE,8,2
14,"I dont think theres ever been an appointment in my life where I wanted the other guy to show up. (George notices an elderly man in a leather chair.) Wait a second, is that him?",GEORGE,8,2
15,Im nervous.,GEORGE,8,2
16,"Its a great thrill to meet you, Sir.",GEORGE,8,2
17,"And, Ill have a club soda with no ice.",GEORGE,8,2
18,You like ice?,GEORGE,8,2
19,"I said, do you like ice?",GEORGE,8,2
20,Dont you think you get more without it?,GEORGE,8,2

34,Where is she?,GEORGE,8,2
35,"How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more minutes, and thats it! Im leaving. I have to tell you, this guy scares me.",GEORGE,8,2
36,"If she doesnt show up, we cant possibly have dinner with him alone.",GEORGE,8,2
37,Well say were frightened and we have to go home.,GEORGE,8,2
38,I dont know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have the crabs. He was in the military. Hell understand that.,GEORGE,8,2

4,"What? What, you dont want to go now?",ELAINE,8,2

7,Try it on.,ELAINE,8,2

11,No idea.,ELAINE,8,2
12,There is no park and the team has relocated.,ELAINE,8,2

14,"Well, its just a lining. You can always have it changed.",ELAINE,8,2
15,Im sorry. Im so sorry. Where is Dad?,ELAINE,8,2
16,"Kramer! That... Kramer! Im just about to leave, he calls me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick up these birds...",ELAINE,8,2
17,"Well, he said hed drive me here right after. So, I am sitting in his car twenty minutes! He doesnt come down. I am freezing. Then a cop comes by, tells me to get out of the car. Hes a city marshal. Hes towing the car away. Kramer owes thousands of dollars in back tickets. He was going to tow it with me in the car! So, they tow the car. Now, I am standing outside, and I am freezing, but I cannot leave because I have to tell him what happened to the car. So, finally, he finally comes down with his giant cage filled with doves. He said he was getting special instructions, that each dove has a different diet... So, were wandering around trying to get a cab, when two of these doves fly out! Now were running down the street after these doves; I almost got hit by a bus! (Elaine sits in Altons chair and takes a deep breath.) So hows everything going over here?",ELAINE,8,2
18,Good. Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.,ELAINE,8,2

21,No one.,ELAINE,8,2
22,Fine.,ELAINE,8,2
23,"Yeah, Im reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I told you ten times.",ELAINE,8,2
24,Ohh... its snowing. Its beautiful.,ELAINE,8,2
25,Yeah.,ELAINE,8,2
26,"Okay. (to Kramer) Hello. (to Jerry) Listen, thanks again for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.",ELAINE,8,2
27,"No, hes driving back to Maryland tonight.",ELAINE,8,2
28,"(to Jerry) I didnt want to tell you this, but usually he hates everyone.",ELAINE,8,2
29,"Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded him of somebody he knew in Korea.",ELAINE,8,2
30,Dad thinks George is gay.,ELAINE,8,2
31,"No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.",ELAINE,8,2

14,"Well, yeah. Okay. Ill take it. I like the jacket.",KRAMER,8,2

16,"(to Jerry) Hey. Hey, would you do me a solid?",KRAMER,8,2
17,I need you to sit in the car for two minutes while its double-parked. I gotta pick up some birds.,KRAMER,8,2
18,"Yeah. A friend of mine, hes a magician. Hes going away on vacation. He asked me to take care of his doves.",KRAMER,8,2
19,They wont take a cage full of birds.,KRAMER,8,2
20,"George, do me a solid? Two minutes.",KRAMER,8,2
21,"All right... Yeah. All right, have a good one.",KRAMER,8,2
22,Hey.,KRAMER,8,2
23,Ive gotta feed the birds.,KRAMER,8,2
24,You got any of those mini Ritzes?,KRAMER,8,2
25,"Yeah! Well, are you going out?",KRAMER,8,2
26,"Hey, wheres your new jacket? (Jerry points to the jacket hanging in the bathroom. Its ruined.) What? (Kramer enters the bathroom, and sees the garment.) Ohhh. What did you do to it?",KRAMER,8,2
27,Dont you know what that does to suede?,KRAMER,8,2
28,"So, uh... what are you gonna do with that one now?",KRAMER,8,2
29,(smiling) Well...,KRAMER,8,2
30,You gonna throw this out?,KRAMER,8,2
31,"(to Jerry) Well, if youre just gonna throw it out, you know, I could take it.",KRAMER,8,2
32,"Hey, see, I like it like this.",KRAMER,8,2
33,"Boy, its too bad you gave me this one too.",KRAMER,8,2
34,Im gonna have to do something about this lining.,KRAMER,8,2

Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? We have soda, we have soda, we have soda, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. Its a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and youre watching TV and youre drinking the exact same product that theyre advertising right there on TV, and its like, you know, theyre spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and Im standing there, Maybe Im putting too much ice in mine.",JERRY,9,2

23,"Of course you do, but youre imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, Oh no, I dont drink coffee late at night. If I call her now, shes gonna think Im too needy. Women dont wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy  a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.",GEORGE,9,2

33,Now Im in the worst position of all.,GEORGE,9,2
34,He did that?,GEORGE,9,2

48,You are not gonna believe whats going on with this woman.,GEORGE,9,2
49,"Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesnt call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, I know youre there, I dont know what your story is. Yesterday, Im a volcano  I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, Where the hell do you get the nerve?

Id like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.",GEORGE,9,2
50,I lost it.,GEORGE,9,2
51,She did. Today.,GEORGE,9,2
52,"She called my office. She said shes been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didnt know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and shes been using her old machine and she doesnt have the beeper for it.",GEORGE,9,2
53,"Exactly, but theyre on there  waiting. She said she cant wait to see me, were having dinner tonight. Shes supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.",GEORGE,9,2
54,Ill meet her outside the building.,GEORGE,9,2
55,"Unless she goes for the bathroom. Thats my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I cant do this, I cant do this. I dont even know how to work those stupid machines.",GEORGE,9,2
56,You do it for me.,GEORGE,9,2
57,"Come on, itll be so much easier.",GEORGE,9,2

64,"A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, Ill call out tippy-toe!",GEORGE,9,2
65,You dont like tippy toe?,GEORGE,9,2
66,"All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, Ill sing.",GEORGE,9,2
67,How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?,GEORGE,9,2

76,"I, I couldnt wait. I was too anxious to see you.",GEORGE,9,2
77,"Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isnt that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.",GEORGE,9,2
78,"You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.",GEORGE,9,2
79,Dont you wanna go upstairs first?,GEORGE,9,2
80,"Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...",GEORGE,9,2
81,I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.,GEORGE,9,2
82,"Right, right.",GEORGE,9,2
83,"No, no that can happen. Ive, uh, Ive read about that in medical journals. Its a freak thing, but...",GEORGE,9,2

85,"Please, this is very, very important.",GEORGE,9,2

0,I once broke up with a guy because he didnt keep his bathroom clean enough.,ELAINE,9,2
1,"Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there  they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.",ELAINE,9,2

3,Maybe coffee was coffee.,ELAINE,9,2
4,Well some people drink coffee that late.,ELAINE,9,2

13,"Yknow, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guys machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasnt supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guys house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.",ELAINE,9,2
14,Yeah.,ELAINE,9,2
0,"Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, youre up there, youre on the stage and you go, Hey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someones in a life-and-death situation, and were thinking, Well, sorry buddy, you shouldve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.",KRAMER,9,2

7,"One hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If theyre not Dockers, theyre just pants",KRAMER,9,2
8,What happened there?,KRAMER,9,2
0,"Well, I painted my apartment again. Ive been living in this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it kinda gets me down. I look around, and I think, well, its a little bit smaller now. You know, I realize its just the thickness of the paint, but Im aware of it. It just coming in and coming in. Every-time I paint it, its closer and closer. I dont even know where the wall outlets are anymore. I just look for like a lump with two slots in it. Kinda looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side. Thats where I plug in. My idea of the perfect living room would be the bridge on the Starship Enterprise. You know what I mean? Big chair, nice screen, remote control... Thats why Star Trek really was the ultimate male fantasy. Just hurtling through space in your living room, watching TV. Thats why all the aliens were always dropping in, because Kirk was the only one that had the big screen. They came over Friday nights, Klingon boxing, gotta be there.",JERRY,10,2

11,"(coyly) Oh, nothing important.",JERRY,10,2
12,What look? Nothing.,JERRY,10,2
13,"I dont know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down. I cant decide.",JERRY,10,2

Youre out somewhere with people, Gee, you look pregnant.. are you? Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, thats not gonna work at all. Walk out the door, and come back in. Lets take this whole scene again.

45,Two minutes.,JERRY,10,2

See now, women will stop and go, ""Well, let me see what the show is before I change the channel."" You see? Men just fly. Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we watch TV differently. Before there was flipping around, before there was television, kings and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would tell them stories 'cause that was their entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip around. Just go, ""Alright start telling me a story, what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next guy. What do you got?

56,"First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight. People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we have boxing either. It's really kind of an amazing thing. To me, the problem with boxing is - you have two guys having a fight that have no prior argument. Why don't they have the boxers come into the ring in little cars, drive around a bit, have a little accident? They get out, ""Didn't you see my signal?"" ""Look at that fender!"" ..Then you'd see a real fight.",JERRY,17,2

The busboy answers) Uh, I'm sorry to bother you, I was in the restaurant earlier and I was wondering if I could talk to you for a few minutes about what happened. (He gestures for them to come in. They obey) I hope I'm not interrupting anything. It's just that I think I may have - without realizing it - been responsible for getting you fired.

At Queens Boulevard, I took the shoulder. At Jewel Avenue, I used the median. I had it. I was there.. and then.. I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen, I tell you this - I came as close as anyone ever has.

We used to let him out of his cage, and he would fly around and my mother had built, one entire wall of our living room was mirrored. She felt this gives you a feeling of space. Have you ever heard this interior design principle that a mirror makes it seem like you have an entire other room? What kind of a jerk walks up to a mirror and goes, ""Hey look, there's a whole nother room in there. There's a guy in there looks just like me."" But the parakeet will fall for this, you'll let him out of his cage, he flies around the room, BANG! With his little head, he would just go 'click' Ohh! And I'd always think, even if he thinks the mirror is another room, why doesn't he at least try to avoid hitting the other parakeet?",JERRY,21,3

18,Alright.,JERRY,23,3

I don't want to think about the nose. I don't ask to think about the nose, but I think about it. I go to bed at night, I tell myself, 'Don't think about the nose, forget the nose,' but I think about it. I look at her, I see nose.",GEORGE,26,3
19,"I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had a smaller nose, I never could have gone out with her in the first place. She'd be out of my league with a smaller nose. And I really like her, I know that. And I know one other thing. I'm not getting past that nose.",GEORGE,26,3

30,Peter Jennings had one.,GEORGE,26,3
31,"Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating class had them. Of course, I'm from Long Island, so...",GEORGE,26,3
32,"It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.",GEORGE,26,3
33,It's a cleaning.,GEORGE,26,3

45,He still wins but it's not a blowout.,GEORGE,26,3
46,Good for you.,GEORGE,26,3
47,It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and not caring.,GEORGE,26,3
48,"Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember that I was the one that encouraged you to do this, you know? Now that you're gonna be a great beauty, let's not forget how this all began. You know, like if you'd listened to your friend, Elaine,",GEORGE,26,3
49,Yeah?,GEORGE,26,3

54,"It's like, all dented.",GEORGE,26,3
55,"Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern science. Can't stop it, you can't stop it. Can't stop science. Can't be stopped, no way, no how, science just marches--",GEORGE,26,3

65,Oh yeah. My friend lived there.,GEORGE,26,3
66,"You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on a plane right now. I get those FAA reports directly. My uncle sends them to me, he used to be a pilot, so. Big investigation in the, uh, what's the word there, uh, offing. It's in the offing. But, you know, you shouldn't let that stop you from going. You could go. I don't mind.",GEORGE,26,3

46,"That's a lot of pressure.  Make love to me.  What am I, in the circus? What if I can't deliver?",GEORGE,27,3
47,"I can't perform under pressure.  That's why I never play anything for money, I choke.  I could choke tonight.  And she works in my office, can you imagine?  She goes around telling everyone what happened?  Maybe I should cancel, I have a very bad feeling about this.",GEORGE,27,3

I spend half my day writing.  Then afterwards, I sit in my office and analyze how it went.  If it was a good conversation, I don't go to the bathroom for the rest of the day.  I see her laughing and talking with other people, they're all so loose and relaxed, I think, 'that used to be me.  I want to go back there again.'",GEORGE,27,3

I have a wonderful time when I'm with you, wonderful! But at this point in my life, I'm not really sure that I'm ready to make a commitment to one person.

18,"Oh yeah, he was drinking something, it started to come out of his nose.",KRAMER,28,3
19,I got a line in the movie!,KRAMER,28,3
20,"Pretty good, huh?",KRAMER,28,3

28,"These pretzels are making me thirsty. (He bites into a pretzel.) Boy, these pretzels are making me thirsty.",KRAMER,28,3
29,What happened here?,KRAMER,28,3
30,What's an extremity?,KRAMER,28,3
31,"You raise the head, you get blood to the feet.",KRAMER,28,3
32,What about a big sponge?,KRAMER,28,3

34,"LAINE and KRAMER: (at the same time) Yes, yes.",KRAMER,28,3
35,"Yeah, I've seen them do that.",KRAMER,28,3
36,Maybe that's what he's got.,KRAMER,28,3
37,Well he could have dropped acid when you weren't looking.,KRAMER,28,3
38,Can you give him a cookie?,KRAMER,28,3

43,"He said, 'Who's the moron in the blue jacket who's got the street all screwed up?'",KRAMER,28,3
44,"Alright, I'll tell you what. Next time I talk to him, maybe I'll bring it up. I'll feel him out.",KRAMER,28,3

50,"Well, one of the pieces must have hit Woody. He started crying. And he yells out, 'I'm bleeding' and he runs off. Anyway, this woman, she came up to me and she says, 'You're fired.' Boy I really nailed that scene.",KRAMER,28,3
0,"I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing there having people comming in all day going ""I need knives. I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for. I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack away with.

75,I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.,JERRY,29,3
76,"I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to spend as much time as you can.",JERRY,29,3
77,"Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not my fault you're back on the wagon.",JERRY,29,3
78,In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from town to town?,JERRY,29,3
79,On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of those bottles along the way?,JERRY,29,3

86,Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.,JERRY,29,3
87,Get off of me.,JERRY,29,3
88,"But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's finally off the wagon.",JERRY,29,3

52,"So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth, her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)",GEORGE,29,3
53,Convulsing?,GEORGE,29,3
54,Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.,GEORGE,29,3
55,I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to her.,GEORGE,29,3
56,"So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew she was mopping the floor with me.",GEORGE,29,3

65,You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to say anything.,GEORGE,29,3
66,"Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere. I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything. I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.",GEORGE,29,3
67,This is for you.,GEORGE,29,3

74,Who said that?,GEORGE,29,3
75,"Was that wrong? Should I have not done that?

17,You don't always smell someone from a drink.,ELAINE,29,3
18,What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?,ELAINE,29,3
19,I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but I can't smell it.,ELAINE,29,3

75,"Yeah, all right. All right.",JERRY,32,3

75,"No, forget it, I'm gonna call.",JERRY,33,3
76,"Get away from me, I'm gonna call her.",JERRY,33,3
77,"George, do you wanna fight? Do you wanna fight?",JERRY,33,3
78,I'll just call her when you leave!,JERRY,33,3
79,It is so my business!,JERRY,33,3
80,"Yeah, but--",JERRY,33,3

82,"Take it easy, you guys, just spread out! Don't worry about it, if anything was wrong she would have called you already!",JERRY,33,3
83,Ow! Ow! Twist off! Twist off! Twist off!,JERRY,33,3
84,"Oh, hi. Soda?",JERRY,33,3

87,"The type that doesn't return phone calls. I knew we shouldn't have done this, it was a bad idea in the first place, I told you!",JERRY,33,3
88,"I was just trying to help your bitter, twisted friend.",JERRY,33,3
89,"Well, bitter's a judgement call, but she's twisted!",JERRY,33,3
90,"I thought you said they had a good time, is there anything else you're keeping from me?",JERRY,33,3
91,"I'm calling you one if you are one, are you a liar?",JERRY,33,3
92,Get your finger out of my face.,JERRY,33,3

97,Well this is a great place to sit you got here.,JERRY,33,3
98,So what are these?,JERRY,33,3
0,"Why even try anymore? There's no sense to it. I'm never gonna meet anybody, I should just accept it.",GEORGE,33,3
1,"No, I won't.",GEORGE,33,3
2,"I mean it's hard enough to meet a woman you dislike, much less like.",GEORGE,33,3
3,"No. Why must it be so difficult? Why is there all this tension and hostility? Why can't I just walk up to a woman on the street and say, ""Hi. I'm",GEORGE,33,3
4,I mean it's gotten to the point where I'm flirting with operators on the phone. I almost made a date with one.,GEORGE,33,3
5,"I don't want hope. Hope is killing me. My dream is to become hopeless. When you're hopeless, you don't care, and when you don't care, that indifference makes you attractive.",GEORGE,33,3
6,It's my only hope.,GEORGE,33,3
7,Out of the question. Out of the question!,GEORGE,33,3
8,"No! I'm not gonna do that! That's one step away from personal ads! And prostitutes! No! No, I am not going down that road! What does she look like?",GEORGE,33,3
9,How good looking?,GEORGE,33,3
10,Really good looking?,GEORGE,33,3
11,Would you take her out?,GEORGE,33,3
12,"Oh, you hesitated.",GEORGE,33,3
13,"No, something's off here, you hesitated.",GEORGE,33,3
14,"What about the body, what kind of body?",GEORGE,33,3

16,Just nice?,GEORGE,33,3
17,Really good?,GEORGE,33,3
18,What about personality?,GEORGE,33,3
19,Smarter than me? I don't want anyone smarter than me.,GEORGE,33,3
20,"Alright, let's see, let's see. What else. What else. Oh yeah, what does she do?",GEORGE,33,3
21,What kind of hair?,GEORGE,33,3
22,Flowing?,GEORGE,33,3
23,"Is it flowing? I like flowing, cascading hair. Thick lustrous hair is very important to me.",GEORGE,33,3
24,"Yeah, that's right.",GEORGE,33,3
25,Let me ask you this. If you stick your hand in the hair is it easy to get it out?,GEORGE,33,3
26,I'd like to be able to get it out.,GEORGE,33,3
27,"What about the skin? I need a good cheek, I like a good cheek.",GEORGE,33,3
28,Is there a pinkish hue?,GEORGE,33,3
29,"Yes, a rosy glow.",GEORGE,33,3
30,"Who cares about eyebrows? Is she sweet? I like sweet. But not too sweet, you could throw up from that.",GEORGE,33,3
31,"We had an incredible phone conversation. We talked for like twenty minutes. I threw away my notes in the middle of the call. You know, I thought she had a great voice timbre. Is it timbre or tamber?",GEORGE,33,3
32,"Why'd I think it was timbre? Yeah, she could do voiceover commercials, why didn't you tell me about her voice?",GEORGE,33,3
33,It's mellifluous!,GEORGE,33,3
34,"She had to be impressed by that conversation, had to! It was a great performance. I am unbelievable on the phone. On the date they should just have two phones on the table at the restaurant, done.",GEORGE,33,3
35,Hey! Saturday night!,GEORGE,33,3
36,"So, what did she say?",GEORGE,33,3
37,That's it?,GEORGE,33,3
38,She didn't mention anything about the conversation?,GEORGE,33,3
39,"Now, you see, I don't get that. We had a relaxed stimulating, great conversation, she doesn't mention it? Why doesn't she mention it?",GEORGE,33,3
40,"Alright, alright, I'll go on the date, but that's that.",GEORGE,33,3
41,What are you gonna do with all of them?,GEORGE,33,3
42,I'll take one. It's possible.,GEORGE,33,3
43,"Yeah, it's me, I just got home.",GEORGE,33,3
44,"Alright look, I'm gonna tell you, but I made a pact with Cynthia, we swore we were not going to tell you and Elaine.",GEORGE,33,3
45,It's in the vault?,GEORGE,33,3
46,We had sex.,GEORGE,33,3
47,I don't know. I closed my eyes and made a move.,GEORGE,33,3
48,Yeah.,GEORGE,33,3
49,"No, she left. Listen, you can't mention any of this to Elaine. Cynthia will kill me, we made a deal.",GEORGE,33,3
50,"I left three messages. I can't believe this woman. She has sex with me, leaves ten minutes later then I never hear from her again. What kind of a person does this? I mean, she used me. I feel cheap and violated.",GEORGE,33,3
51,What are you gonna do?,GEORGE,33,3
52,"I keep wracking my brain to try and figure out what I did. I was smart, I was funny, I made great small talk with the waitress so she could see I could relate to the commoners, you know, I'm a man of the people.",GEORGE,33,3
53,"No, don't call her.",GEORGE,33,3
54,"No, Jerry, don't call.",GEORGE,33,3
55,I don't want you to call.,GEORGE,33,3
56,Give me the phone!,GEORGE,33,3
57,"Jerry, I'm gonna kill you!",GEORGE,33,3
58,"You can't do that, it's none of your business!",GEORGE,33,3
59,But tell him to give me the--,GEORGE,33,3
60,No.,GEORGE,33,3
61,What?,GEORGE,33,3
62,Defective?!,GEORGE,33,3
63,(attacking Kramer) How could you give me a defective condom?!,GEORGE,33,3
64,What do you mean you didn't think I wasn't gonna use them?!,GEORGE,33,3
65,She missed her period? Oh my god. I can't believe it! I'm a father! I did it! My boys can swim! I can do it! I can do it!,GEORGE,33,3
66,"Sorry, we're a little late. We got so hung up in traffic.",GEORGE,33,3
67,"(hitting Cynthia playfully with a napkin) Stop it, stop it.",GEORGE,33,3
68,"(with a mouth full of food) This is good. Oh, this is good.",GEORGE,33,3
0,I know.,ELAINE,33,3
1,I hate the good ones.,ELAINE,33,3
2,"That's a good question, I think he thinks he is.",ELAINE,33,3
3,"You know, maybe you need somebody between good and mediocre.",ELAINE,33,3
4,"Well, at least you're not bitter.",ELAINE,33,3
5,Aren't you too young to be bitter?,ELAINE,33,3
6,"Don't worry, your bitterness is safe with me.",ELAINE,33,3
7,So what'd you do last night?,ELAINE,33,3
8,Went out with Cynthia.,ELAINE,33,3
9,"Well, you know, the usual; The Federal Reserve, the rainforest. Cynthia thought we should nuke the rainforest, you know, get rid of it in one fell swoop so we can at least eliminate it as a subject of conversation. What about you?",ELAINE,33,3
10,"I know, Cynthia too. She's really given up.",ELAINE,33,3
11,"Uh, me neither and I am not about to start with George.",ELAINE,33,3
12,"I didn't say 'too good', did I say 'too good'?",ELAINE,33,3
13,I didn't say it.,ELAINE,33,3
14,Who is he?,ELAINE,33,3
15,She's Cynthia!,ELAINE,33,3
16,"What, you don't think she's beautiful?",ELAINE,33,3
17,You know what your problem is? Your standards are too high.,ELAINE,33,3
18,"That's because my standards are too low. And by the way, you know, women kill for eyebrows like that. Do you know that? I mean women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head, one by one, until they're bald, Jerry. Bald above the eyes! And then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.",ELAINE,33,3
19,He can really do that?,ELAINE,33,3
20,"What, are you into this?",ELAINE,33,3
21,"No, wait a minute, wait a minute. They're gonna be telling us how their dates went. Are we gonna share that information?",ELAINE,33,3
22,"Well, wait a minute, we're gonna tell each other everything, I mean every secret?",ELAINE,33,3
23,What if it worked out?,ELAINE,33,3
24,"He was in real estate, um, now, he's not working right now-",ELAINE,33,3
25,"Well, um, he, he got fired.",ELAINE,33,3
26,"Uh. Why? Oh, right. Um, well, he tried to poison his boss.",ELAINE,33,3
27,"Such a long story, Cynthia, seriously, I mean he just had some problems at work.",ELAINE,33,3
28,"No, no, no, he's a really really funny guy.",ELAINE,33,3
29,Pardon?,ELAINE,33,3
30,"Um, well, he's got a lot of character in his face. Um, he's short. Um, he's stocky.",ELAINE,33,3
31,"Powerful. He is so powerful, he can lift a hundred pounds right up over his head. And um, what else. What else. Oh, right. Um, well, he's kind of, just kind of losing his hair.",ELAINE,33,3
32,"No! No, no, no, he's not bald. He's balding.",ELAINE,33,3
33,Yup.,ELAINE,33,3
34,No.,ELAINE,33,3
35,He once spent a weekend with a woman.,ELAINE,33,3
36,"Yeah, he did.",ELAINE,33,3

39,She said you're getting together Saturday night!,ELAINE,33,3
40,Yeah!,ELAINE,33,3
41,No.,ELAINE,33,3
42,What?,ELAINE,33,3
43,"Half a bag? What am I, a hooker? Anyway, they look kind of cheap.",ELAINE,33,3
44,I think they went out to dinner.,ELAINE,33,3
45,"Yeah, yeah, I got Cynthia on the other line.",ELAINE,33,3
46,Remember our pact. Full disclosure.,ELAINE,33,3
47,Oh my god.,ELAINE,33,3
48,So? How was it?,ELAINE,33,3
49,"Wait, I got another call, that must be Jerry.",ELAINE,33,3
50,"Yeah, ok. [clicks over] Hello?",ELAINE,33,3
51,What did he have to say?,ELAINE,33,3
52,Her too.,ELAINE,33,3
53,Anything else?,ELAINE,33,3
54,Nope.,ELAINE,33,3
55,Yup. You?,ELAINE,33,3
56,"Alright. Well uh, guess everything is under control.",ELAINE,33,3
57,Alright. Goodnight.,ELAINE,33,3
58,Oh my god.,ELAINE,33,3
59,"But he used a condom, right?",ELAINE,33,3
60,Oh no.,ELAINE,33,3
61,Was it blue?,ELAINE,33,3
62,Just a hunch.,ELAINE,33,3
63,No thanks.,ELAINE,33,3
64,Who are you to talk about her like that? She'll call him when she's good and ready. You don't even know her.,ELAINE,33,3
65,Her type? What type?,ELAINE,33,3
66,"You told me? You pushed this whole thing on me, it was your idea!",ELAINE,33,3
67,She's not bitter!,ELAINE,33,3
68,"Twisted? God, I did you a favor.",ELAINE,33,3
69,Are you calling me a liar?,ELAINE,33,3
70,Are you?,ELAINE,33,3
71,"You get yours out, I was here first!",ELAINE,33,3
72,Get it out!,ELAINE,33,3
73,I knew those condoms were defective!,ELAINE,33,3

5,"Hey hey hey!! Come on! Jerry, George, now stop it!",KRAMER,33,3
6,Hey hey hey! I don't want to hear another word out of either one of you!,KRAMER,33,3
7,"Ay ay ay! The next one of you that opens up your mouth, says something, you're gonna have to deal with me. You know, I bet I know what this is about. It's about a woman, isn't it?",KRAMER,33,3
8,"Yeah yeah! You see, this is exactly what they want to do to you. They play one against the other. You can't let them manipulate you like that.",KRAMER,33,3
9,"Noh noh noh! I want you guys to shake hands. Come on, there are plenty of women out there for all of us, let's go.",KRAMER,33,3
10,"Yes. You see? Isn't that better than fighting? Animosity? I mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me. Oh, by the way George, you know those condoms I gave you? They're defective, don't use them.",KRAMER,33,3
11,Right.,KRAMER,33,3
12,Defective.,KRAMER,33,3
13,I didn't even know they were defective.,KRAMER,33,3
14,Didn't even thin you were gonna use them.,KRAMER,33,3
15,"Hey hey, alright, hey hey, stop it! Come on, break it up! What's the matter with you? Now don't you two see that you're in love with each other? I mean, why can't you face that already? You're running around out there looking for something that's not even there, when everything that you dream of is right here, right here in front of you. Now why can't you admit that? By the way, when you see George give him these, these'll work.",KRAMER,33,3
0,"I have to dribble, if I give it to you, you just shoot. You're a chucker.",JERRY,34,3
1,"That's right, everytime you get the ball you shoot.",JERRY,34,3
2,You chuck.,JERRY,34,3
3,Well it's not an easy thing to bring up.,JERRY,34,3
4,Believe me I didn't see anything.,JERRY,34,3
5,"No, did you?",JERRY,34,3
6,Why?,JERRY,34,3
7,I made a conscious effort not to look. There's certain information I just don't want to have.,JERRY,34,3
8,All right,JERRY,34,3
9,All right,JERRY,34,3
10,You know who that is? That's,JERRY,34,3
11,"Yeah, that's him.",JERRY,34,3

13,"Yeah, he's a real smart guy too. He's a Civil War buff.",JERRY,34,3
14,So Biff wants to be a buff? ... Well sleeping less than 18 hours a day would be a start.,JERRY,34,3
15,"Hey, should we say something to him?",JERRY,34,3
16,well he could say hello to me. I wouldn't mind.,JERRY,34,3
17,So?,JERRY,34,3
18,I know what he is. I recognized him. You didn't even notice him.,JERRY,34,3
19,Really?,JERRY,34,3
20,What I do? You are one of my favorite ball players of all time,JERRY,34,3
21,Thank you.,JERRY,34,3
22,I'm performing in this club on the east Side. You should come in.,JERRY,34,3
23,"I'll tell you what, I'll give you my number and uh, just give me a call, tell me whenever you want to go.",JERRY,34,3
24,Oh. that would be great.,JERRY,34,3
25,It's been three days and he hasn't called.,JERRY,34,3
26,I can't ... I can't,JERRY,34,3
27,I don't know. I just feel he should call me.,JERRY,34,3
28,"You don't understand, Elaine. I don't want to be overanxious. If he wants to see me he has my number, he should call.",JERRY,34,3
29,I can't stand these guys. You give your number to them and then they don't call. Why do they do that?,JERRY,34,3
30,"I mean, I thought he liked me. I really thought he liked me. we were getting along. He came over to me I didn't go over to him.",JERRY,34,3
31,Why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?,JERRY,34,3
32,"What did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me? I mean here I meet this guy this great guy, a baseball player, best guy I ever met in my life. .. Well that's it. I'm never giving my number out to another guy again.",JERRY,34,3
33,"Hu, good, good,... well if he's calling in a month he's got a prayer!",JERRY,34,3
34,"Oh, they don't have phones out of town? Why do(?) people say they're too busy. Too busy. Pick up a phone!! It takes two minutes. How can you be too busy?",JERRY,34,3
35,"I can't call here, it's a coffee shop. I mean what am I going to say to him?",JERRY,34,3
36,For what dinner?,JERRY,34,3
37,Don't you think that's coming on a little too strong? .. Isn't that like a turn off?,JERRY,34,3
38,... this is all .. very confusing.,JERRY,34,3
39,"Elaine, how about this shirt? Is this okay?",JERRY,34,3
40,"Oh, see the baby again with the baby..",JERRY,34,3
41,"Uh, he's this guy who used to live in the building and they keep calling us to see the baby.",JERRY,34,3
42,(imitates) Ya' gotta see the babi - When are ya' gonna see the babi... Can't they just send us a tape?,JERRY,34,3
43,uh uh because then it would be all grown up.,JERRY,34,3
44,Hey Kramer what do you think of this shirt?,JERRY,34,3
45,I know he's just a guy but .. I LIKE him.,JERRY,34,3
46,"Uh, Keith uh Hernandez.",JERRY,34,3
47,Hellooo Newman.,JERRY,34,3
48,Unfortunately the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account. Allow me to reconstruct this if I may for Miss Benes as I've heard this story a number of times.,JERRY,34,3
49,"Newman, Kramer, if you'll indulge me. According to your story Keith passes you and starts walking up the ramp then you say you were struck on the right temple. The spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple striking Newman between the third and forth rib. The spit then cam off the rib turned and hit Newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap. The spit then splashed off the wrist, Pauses In mid air mind you- makes a left turn and lands on Newman's left thigh. That is one magic luggie.",JERRY,34,3
50,What happened to your head when you got hit?,JERRY,34,3
51,Again,JERRY,34,3
52,Back and to the left Back and to the left,JERRY,34,3
53,I am saying that the spit could not have come from behind ... that there had to have been a second spitter behind the bushes on the gravelly road. If the spitter was behind you as you claimed that would have caused your head to pitch forward.,JERRY,34,3
54,But that is not what they would have you believe.,JERRY,34,3
55,The sad thing is we may never know the real truth.,JERRY,34,3
56,No. What happened to you?,JERRY,34,3
57,I'm Vandelay Industries?,JERRY,34,3
58,And what is that?,JERRY,34,3
59,Latex? And what do I do with latex?,JERRY,34,3
60,And what do I say about you?,JERRY,34,3
61,I'm going to hire you as my latex salesman?,JERRY,34,3
62,I don't think so. Why would I do that?,JERRY,34,3
63,"If you think I'm looking for someone to just sit at a desk pushing papers around, you can forget it. I have enough headaches just trying to manufacture the stuff.",JERRY,34,3
64,Yeah.,JERRY,34,3
65,All right we're coming down.,JERRY,34,3
66,"Yeah, come on Elaine, lets go.",JERRY,34,3
67,That's what I've been trying to figure out the past five years.,JERRY,34,3
68,"Well that was really fun, thanks.",JERRY,34,3
69,"Well, ...",JERRY,34,3
70,"No, I haven't.",JERRY,34,3
71,"Sure, that would be great.",JERRY,34,3
72,"I mean, ... if you want to.",JERRY,34,3
73,"Yeah, Friday's okay.",JERRY,34,3
74,"Well, good night [holds hand out and shakes hand]",JERRY,34,3
75,Elaine?,JERRY,34,3
76,"Uh, I don't know, we used to go out.",JERRY,34,3
77,For a date?,JERRY,34,3
78,"Oh, no, uh, go ahead. You got a pen?",JERRY,34,3
79,.... (silence),JERRY,34,3
80,So then we went to dinner.,JERRY,34,3
81,We split it.,JERRY,34,3
82,"Naw, I gotta wait until its just the right time.",JERRY,34,3
83,Yeah,JERRY,34,3
84,Come on up.,JERRY,34,3
85,"Uh, nuthin'. Then he took me home.",JERRY,34,3
86,(smiling) Yeah,JERRY,34,3
87,"Good shake. Perfect shake. Single pump, not too hard, you know, doesn't have to prove anything, but, you know, firm enough to know he was there.",JERRY,34,3
88,He asked me if I was doing anything Friday night.,JERRY,34,3
89,"So then as I was getting out of the car, ...",JERRY,34,3
90,Hi Elaine.,JERRY,34,3
91,What date? It's a GUY.,JERRY,34,3
92,Already?,JERRY,34,3
93,I don't mind at all. Why should I mind? What did he say?,JERRY,34,3
94,"Oh, ya' going?",JERRY,34,3
95,"Ah, really.",JERRY,34,3
96,Friday?,JERRY,34,3
97,He's going' out with you on Friday?,JERRY,34,3

58,"Well, I was exaggerating a bit, just for effect.",GEORGE,36,3
59,"Okay, I mean it's serious but--",GEORGE,36,3

80,Me??,GEORGE,36,3
81,He's extremely Murphy. He's Murphy to a fault.,GEORGE,36,3
82,"Those are my friends I was telling you about. We're gonna talk to them, pull over.",GEORGE,36,3
83,What do I do?! What do I do?!,GEORGE,36,3

5,Just in those commercials.,ELAINE,36,3
6,What's that?,ELAINE,36,3
7,Huh?,ELAINE,36,3
8,Jerry and George called me from this limo and they said we're all going to the Knicks-Bulls game.,ELAINE,36,3
9,He did.,ELAINE,36,3
10,I don't know.,ELAINE,36,3

12,"Dan! Oh, hi Dan, how are you?",ELAINE,36,3
13,"Um, oh, this is um, Kramer.",ELAINE,36,3

16,"Oh, well, maybe we'll run into you.",ELAINE,36,3
17,I'm sure he was just joking around.,ELAINE,36,3
18,What is it?,ELAINE,36,3
19,Jerry's a nazi?!,ELAINE,36,3
20,"Listen, you idiot! Just calm down! I know Jerry, he's not a nazi.",ELAINE,36,3

4,I'll tell you how much I make.,KRAMER,36,3
5,You ever seen Michael Jordan?,KRAMER,36,3

7,"Oh, it's like this, here, you guard me.",KRAMER,36,3
8,Yeah.,KRAMER,36,3
9,"So what's going on, how did all this happen?",KRAMER,36,3
10,Limo? I thought that George went to pick him up.,KRAMER,36,3
11,Well then why would they take a limo from the airport?,KRAMER,36,3
12,That's pretty strange. Did he say anything else?,KRAMER,36,3
13,O'Brien. Why would he want to be called O'Brien?,KRAMER,36,3
14,"Something's very strange. George goes to the airport to pick up Jerry. They come back in a limo with four tickets to the basketball game and wanna be called O'Brien and Murphy? O'Brien. O'Brien, why O'Brien?",KRAMER,36,3
15,Who?,KRAMER,36,3
16,"I'm telling you, something's going on. I can feel it, sense it.",KRAMER,36,3
17,"Oh no no no, this is no joke. O'Brien's coming in from Chicago, Jerry's in a limo, says he's O'Brien? That's not funny. Oh my god. Yes. Yes!",KRAMER,36,3
18,"Don't you see? There's always been something very strange about Jerry, always so clean and organized. Do I have to spell it out for you? The limo? The name? The rally at Madison Square Garden? Jerry, O'Brien are the same person. Jerry is the leader of the Aryan Union!",KRAMER,36,3
19,I can't believe I didn't see it.,KRAMER,36,3
20,You don't think so.,KRAMER,36,3
21,Maybe he's with the company.,KRAMER,36,3
22,The CIA! Maybe they placed him in there to infiltrate the organization from within.,KRAMER,36,3
23,"That's the perfect cover! All that time on the road? Look Jerry, he's too normal to be a comedian. These comedians, they're sick, neurotic people.",KRAMER,36,3
24,"What about him, he's part of it. His whole personality is a disguise. No real person can act the way he does. Elaine, I'm telling you they're with the organization. They're all part of it. He's in there with Helms and Hunt and Liddy, that whole crowd. George and Jerry, they probably know who killed Kennedy!",KRAMER,36,3
25,"Alright, what are we gonna do? I'm not gonna let him hurt you. (grabs and hugs Elaine tightly) I'm not gonna.",KRAMER,36,3
26,O'Brien.,KRAMER,36,3
27,"(pointing to Jerry) O'Brien. Long time no see. How's tricks, Murphy?",KRAMER,36,3
28,Yeah? Eva?,KRAMER,36,3
29,O'Brien? Well that's weird.,KRAMER,36,3
0,It's safer! Plus it's more annoying to the other person.,JERRY,37,3
1,Oh look at this guy.,JERRY,37,3
2,"Oh there's a guy trying to get in front of me, he has to ask permission. Yes. Go ahead. Get in, get in.",JERRY,37,3
3,"No, nothing. How could you not give a thank you wave? Hey buddy! Where's my thank you wave?",JERRY,37,3
4,Give me that wave!,JERRY,37,3
5,"Yeah, I'm free, why?",JERRY,37,3
6,"Oh my God! You won't believe what I just saw! A car just bashed into a parked car, and sped off, right on my block!",JERRY,37,3
7,What?,JERRY,37,3
8,"Elaine, the guy could be dangerous.",JERRY,37,3
9,I'm not yella. (In a cowboy voice),JERRY,37,3
10,"Wait, he stopped, he's parking.",JERRY,37,3
11,"Uh, excuse me, uh, I was uh, driving behind you, uh, a few blocks back, and I, I couldn't help, uh, maybe you didn't realize, uh, I witnessed that, uh, um, you're tire's a little low. That can affect the performance of the twin high-beam suspension, not to mention your rack and pinion steering.",JERRY,37,3
12,So I wound up going out for a decaf cappuccino with her.,JERRY,37,3
13,"You know, I really liked her. We talked. We flirted. And when she left, she reached out and touched my arm.",JERRY,37,3
14,"He, he, he. (Simulating her feminine laugh)",JERRY,37,3
15,Let's not even analyze it.,JERRY,37,3
16,I wanted to but I couldn't go through with it.,JERRY,37,3
17,Friday night.,JERRY,37,3
18,Yep.,JERRY,37,3
19,Come on up.,JERRY,37,3
20,"By the way, Elaine does not need to know about anything.",JERRY,37,3
21,"Oh, you dig?",JERRY,37,3
22,Why?,JERRY,37,3
23,I wonder if I'm nuts for pursuing this woman at all.,JERRY,37,3
24,"Look, she slammed into a parked car! She took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger, then she sped off like a criminal!",JERRY,37,3
25,"On the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again? You scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?!",JERRY,37,3
26,"What am I drinking, milk?",JERRY,37,3
27,Hi.,JERRY,37,3
28,Thank you.,JERRY,37,3
29,With that?,JERRY,37,3
30,What car?,JERRY,37,3
31,"Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right, right, the hit and run. Well. Actually, the guy went into Queens.",JERRY,37,3
32,Over the bridge. (Making a pointing motion with his hand),JERRY,37,3
33,"Yeah, Queens.",JERRY,37,3
34,"So he gets out of the car, I say, ""Hey buddy! I saw you hit that car!"" So he says to me, ""What are ya gonna do about it?""",JERRY,37,3
35,"So I said to him, ""Whatever's necessary.""",JERRY,37,3
36,What?,JERRY,37,3
37,"Oh, it was nothing.",JERRY,37,3
38,"Well he kinda lost his temper, and he was pushing me up against the car. So I went into a karate stance. (Jerry assumes karate position and does two punches)",JERRY,37,3
39,I know a little.,JERRY,37,3
40,He backed off. Pretty pathetic actually.,JERRY,37,3
41,"Ah, nah! (Waving his hand and walking away)",JERRY,37,3
42,Australia?,JERRY,37,3
43,But not anymore.,JERRY,37,3
44,"Oh Friday, I can't, I'm sorry, I have a date.",JERRY,37,3
45,We just met.,JERRY,37,3
46,Ask George to go with you.,JERRY,37,3
47,Why do you even need anybody?,JERRY,37,3
48,"Oh, Anthony Quinn, fine actor. But from what I understand, not a very good driver. Hits everything on the road. But always leaves a note.",JERRY,37,3
49,Excellent film. In fact Quinn said he never felt so good as when he left a note after smacking into a car.,JERRY,37,3
50,"Kirk Douglas. Now there's another very bad driver. But he's such an unbelievable guy, that when he hits someone, he doesn't even leave a note. He sits in his car and waits for the other person to show up so he can exchange license, registration, and apologize.",JERRY,37,3
51,"The question is, did you allow a space for the husband to come in with his 'God bless you'? Because as the husband, he has the right to first refusal.",JERRY,37,3
52,Come on up.,JERRY,37,3
53,"No argument. Unless, she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his 'God bless you' in abeyance, until she completes the series.",JERRY,37,3
54,What if she's having an off night?,JERRY,37,3
55,Hi.,JERRY,37,3
56,A stupid what?,JERRY,37,3

23,"Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--",GEORGE,38,3
24,--and this is Kramer.,GEORGE,38,3
25,Okay.,GEORGE,38,3
26,"Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what it costs. (beat) Not, uh, too expensive, is it?",GEORGE,38,3
27,Just take the cap off.,GEORGE,38,3
28,Just take the cap off!,GEORGE,38,3
29,(to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?,GEORGE,38,3
30,"Okay, we'll go!",GEORGE,38,3
31,Five-hundred dollars?! What?,GEORGE,38,3
32,I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!,GEORGE,38,3
33,Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!,GEORGE,38,3
34,You weren't thinking.,GEORGE,38,3
35,"Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm buying this! (beat) I mean, look at it! What is it? It's a bunch of squiggly lines! (beat) Are you telling me you couldn't paint this?",GEORGE,38,3
36,"I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her, it'd be a different story.",GEORGE,38,3
37,"Hey, Kramer.",GEORGE,38,3
38,What?,GEORGE,38,3
39,What's it say?,GEORGE,38,3
40,WOW!,GEORGE,38,3

42,"Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?",GEORGE,38,3
43,"Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know, in fact, I've been thinking about it, and I feel like I'm stealing from you! Five-hundred dollars! It's gonna be worth thousands soon! You know what? On second thought, I can't even accept it.",GEORGE,38,3
44,This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with me! It should really be in a doormanned building.,GEORGE,38,3

49,This is incredible!,GEORGE,38,3
50,Maybe I won't send her that check.,GEORGE,38,3
51,Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000? (laughs),GEORGE,38,3
52,So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?,GEORGE,38,3
53,"Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it to you right now for ten bucks.",GEORGE,38,3
54,"Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other day.",GEORGE,38,3
0,"Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.",ELAINE,38,3
1,Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better than this.,ELAINE,38,3
2,I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.,ELAINE,38,3
3,(shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would want to go to a circumcision?,ELAINE,38,3
4,"Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit my father in the hospital in Maryland. (George laughs)",ELAINE,38,3
5,Hi!,ELAINE,38,3
6,"Great, great.",ELAINE,38,3
7,(thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!,ELAINE,38,3
8,You're not serious.,ELAINE,38,3
9,"Well, did he say that?",ELAINE,38,3
10,Well maybe you should ask him!,ELAINE,38,3
11,"No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off? This is ridiculous!!",ELAINE,38,3
12,"George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!",ELAINE,38,3
13,"Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.",ELAINE,38,3
14,No!,ELAINE,38,3
15,"(sarcastically, to George) Stay!",ELAINE,38,3
16,...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls right over the railing!,ELAINE,38,3
17,"Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room, and you know, the x-rays were all negative. (beat) It was quite a day!",ELAINE,38,3
18,I know! Can you imagine that?,ELAINE,38,3
19,Wha- a picture?,ELAINE,38,3
20,OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??,ELAINE,38,3

27,"Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...",ELAINE,38,3
28,"Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit must have buoyed (Elaine says ""boyed"") his spirits.",ELAINE,38,3
29,What--what did I say?,ELAINE,38,3
30,I did?,ELAINE,38,3
31,Oh! Where are you going?,ELAINE,38,3
32,Ah. ...Yeah.,ELAINE,38,3

38,"(sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow, I'll be fired!",ELAINE,38,3
39,"No, he wants to torture me.",ELAINE,38,3
40,"(annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when you're the clicker! You go too fast! (Elain makes a grab for the clicker, instigating a tug-o-war between Elaine and Jerry over the clicker)",ELAINE,38,3
41,You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want! I've never seen you stay on anything for more than 5 seconds. Gimme that.,ELAINE,38,3
42,"No, come on! I want it, Jerry!",ELAINE,38,3

44,"It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.",ELAINE,38,3
45,What letter?,ELAINE,38,3
46,"You know, it's not really that terrible.",ELAINE,38,3
47,"Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.",ELAINE,38,3
48,"Well, uh, fan. My father--",ELAINE,38,3
49,Really?,ELAINE,38,3
50,So... impudent.,ELAINE,38,3
51,"(pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--",ELAINE,38,3
52,(very reluctant) Okay.,ELAINE,38,3
53,That will be fun.,ELAINE,38,3
0,You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off? (beat) Ill do it!,KRAMER,38,3
1,"Well, why dont you take your clothes off?",KRAMER,38,3
2,"(debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.",KRAMER,38,3
3,"Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat) Or, really, they're dark brown, like rich, Columbian coffee.",KRAMER,38,3
4,"She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary Todd.",KRAMER,38,3
5,"Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).",KRAMER,38,3
6,"Why, what's the difference?",KRAMER,38,3
7,"Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.",KRAMER,38,3
8,Yeah!,KRAMER,38,3
9,"George, you gonna buy a painting?",KRAMER,38,3
10,(immediately) Yeah.,KRAMER,38,3
11,"Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog? (Kramer hands out the hot dogs)What a great day!",KRAMER,38,3
12,"(screaming at the players on the field) YOU BETTER CATCH IT,",KRAMER,38,3
13,"(screaming again) HEY, 230 AIN'T GONNA CUT IT IN THIS TOWN, BABE!",KRAMER,38,3
14,"Oh, hey.",KRAMER,38,3
15,Yeah.,KRAMER,38,3

17,"(getting up) I'll go get your hat, George.",KRAMER,38,3

19,A picture.,KRAMER,38,3
20,Uh-huh.,KRAMER,38,3
21,"Yup, yup!",KRAMER,38,3

23,"Hi, Mike.",KRAMER,38,3
24,"(notices the painting) Whoa, man! That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen!",KRAMER,38,3
25,(emotionally) She's deep.,KRAMER,38,3
26,"You know Jerry, she sounds like a poet!",KRAMER,38,3
27,(pushing Jerry towards the phone) Yeah! Get in there and give her a call. Pick up the phone and call her!,KRAMER,38,3
28,"(screaming) YES! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT YOU SHOULD! (hysterically) Fight for her, Jerry, she's sure as hell fighting for you!",KRAMER,38,3
29,"...then, when I was seventeen, I ran away from home and hopped a steamship to Sweden. (beat) This steak is excellent, by the way.",KRAMER,38,3
30,"Yeah, sure. Please.",KRAMER,38,3

0,What are you talking about?,JERRY,39,3
1,Yeah.,JERRY,39,3
2,"Oh yeah, I know.",JERRY,39,3
3,What's the difference?,JERRY,39,3
4,"You always have to know everything that's going on, don't you?",JERRY,39,3
5,"If I don't tell you it will kill you, won't it?",JERRY,39,3
6,"You have to know, you must know.",JERRY,39,3
7,"Well, I'm not telling you.",JERRY,39,3
8,Nope. I don't think so.,JERRY,39,3
9,"Not today, pal.",JERRY,39,3
10,Now see? Just saying beg doesn't make it a real beg. You gotta put some beg into it.,JERRY,39,3
11,"Alright, I'll tell you, but your begging needs a lot of work.",JERRY,39,3
12,I loaned the car to George.,JERRY,39,3
13,"George and Elaine went to a flea market in Westchester, okay?!",JERRY,39,3
14,Huh?,JERRY,39,3
15,Will you stop it already?!,JERRY,39,3
16,I don't know! How am I supposed to know?!,JERRY,39,3
17,*I* don't like you!,JERRY,39,3
18,Why not?,JERRY,39,3
19,Yep. (checks watch) Starts in thirty-five minutes.,JERRY,39,3
20,"No, I like Mike.",JERRY,39,3
21,Oh yeah? What did you talk about?,JERRY,39,3
22,Oh yeah? What did he say?,JERRY,39,3
23,"No, come on, Kramer. What did he say?",JERRY,39,3
24,"Kramer, just tell me what the guy said.",JERRY,39,3
25,"Please, don't make me beg.",JERRY,39,3
26,"Kramer, please tell me what the guy said.",JERRY,39,3
27,Kramer!,JERRY,39,3
28,Well you can't just mention it and then not tell me.,JERRY,39,3
29,"I'm not saying anything, I'm putting it in the vault, I'm locking the vault, it's a vault!",JERRY,39,3
30,He what?,JERRY,39,3
31,A phony? He called me a phony?,JERRY,39,3
32,Why did you tell me that if I can't say anything?!,JERRY,39,3
33,"Yeah, under the counter. What happened?",JERRY,39,3
34,(bending down to pick up the chips) Tell me what happened.,JERRY,39,3
35,He is?,JERRY,39,3
36,A gun?!,JERRY,39,3
37,"My god, are you okay?",JERRY,39,3
38,"Well, I mean, as long as you're okay, that, that's the important thing.",JERRY,39,3
39,Where's George now?,JERRY,39,3
40,What are you talking about?,JERRY,39,3
41,(leaning out the window) Hey Georgie!,JERRY,39,3
42,Are you okay?,JERRY,39,3
43,"Crazy kids, huh?",JERRY,39,3
44,"Oh, hey Mike.",JERRY,39,3
45,I'm coming down.,JERRY,39,3
46,"Hey, your friend Mike's outside, he wants to talk to you.",JERRY,39,3
47,"Yeah, he's a real phony.",JERRY,39,3
48,Hi Mike. (Noticing George's fedora) Indiana.,JERRY,39,3
49,"Yeah, twenty-five percent bran flakes. The forty percent was too much so I found a store to mix it up special for me, they take it down another fifteen percent.",JERRY,39,3
50,"Front first, that's how you park when you're pulling a bank job.",JERRY,39,3
51,I didn't know.,JERRY,39,3
52,I didn't know I wasn't supposed to say anything!,JERRY,39,3
53,You're right. My fault.,JERRY,39,3
54,It was a so-so sorry.,JERRY,39,3
55,"Wild pack of teenagers, huh?",JERRY,39,3
56,"Amazing how they picked you, out of everyone, to terrorize.",JERRY,39,3
57,"Sounds like you did some pretty nifty maneuvering,",JERRY,39,3
58,What did you do to my car?!,JERRY,39,3
59,I thought you said you were a good driver!,JERRY,39,3
60,I think you said driver.,JERRY,39,3
61,Hey Sid.,JERRY,39,3
62,"Okay, George. Come on, let's go. I'm putting it in a garage. The fight's starting in two minutes.",JERRY,39,3
63,"What are we gonna do, stay out here all night?",JERRY,39,3
64,Hey Matthew.,JERRY,39,3
65,How ya doing?,JERRY,39,3
66,"Hey, how's your father? I hear he's closing his store.",JERRY,39,3
67,"Oh no, nothing.",JERRY,39,3
68,"No, no, no, no.",JERRY,39,3
69,"No, of course not, of course not!",JERRY,39,3
70,I didn't--,JERRY,39,3
71,"(to Elaine) Hey, do you think I'm phony?",JERRY,39,3
72,Mike thinks I'm a phony.,JERRY,39,3
73,"Yeah, but I can't say anything because Kramer wasn't supposed to tell me.",JERRY,39,3
74,"I can't, I told Kramer I was vaulting it.",JERRY,39,3
75,Open my vault?,JERRY,39,3
76,"Once I open the vault, it ceases to be a vault.",JERRY,39,3
77,Oy ga-vault.,JERRY,39,3
78,"Alright, that's it. The fight's already started. I'm going upstairs, who's coming? Elaine?",JERRY,39,3
79,Well if he's going then I'm not going.,JERRY,39,3
80,I still don't have to go.,JERRY,39,3
81,Why? I'll tell you why.,JERRY,39,3
82,Like you didn't call me a phony?,JERRY,39,3
83,Use it in a sentence.,JERRY,39,3
84,"Alright, come on. Who wants to watch the fight?",JERRY,39,3
0,I really think it looks good.,GEORGE,39,3
1,All bald people look good in hats.,GEORGE,39,3
2,What a bald paradise that must have been. Nobody knew.,GEORGE,39,3
3,"No, I can't. What if I meet a woman? I'd always be worried about that first moment where I'd take it off and see that look of disappointment on her face.",GEORGE,39,3
4,Do you hear that?,GEORGE,39,3
5,You had to move the mirror?,GEORGE,39,3
6,"I went to look in the mirror, it wasn't there. You threw off my equilibrium.",GEORGE,39,3
7,I can't drive?,GEORGE,39,3
8,"Nobody drives like me. Nobody. I'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on. Wanna see me make a right turn from the left lane? Watch this.",GEORGE,39,3
9,And I can make a left turn from the right lane too.,GEORGE,39,3
10,What are we gonna tell Jerry about the car?,GEORGE,39,3
11,"Alright, start looking for spaces.",GEORGE,39,3
12,"Look, I have my system. First I look for the dream spot right in front of the door, then I slowly expand out in concentric circles.",GEORGE,39,3
13,I can't park in a garage.,GEORGE,39,3
14,"I don't know, I just can't. Nobody in my family can pay for parking, it's a sickness. My father never paid for parking; my mother, my brother, nobody. We can't do it.",GEORGE,39,3
15,"You don't understand. A garage. I can't even pull in there. It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay, when if I apply myself, maybe I could get it for free? (he hears a horn honking) What? What do you want? Go around me, I'm looking for spaces.",GEORGE,39,3
16,"(putting the car in reverse) Oh beautiful! Look at that, the dream space right in front of Jerry's building. Huh? Dreams can come true, what did I tell you?",GEORGE,39,3
17,"Alright, now you're gonna see some parallel parking. (spitting into his hands and rubbing them together) How I wish you could make a living parallel parking. (turning around in his seat) It's all geometry, knowing all the angles, when to make that first turn and then when to swing it back in, that's the key.",GEORGE,39,3
18,"There's nothing I can even impart to you, that's the sad thing. It's so inborn, I can't pass it on. (begins backing into the space) Look at this guy. Are you crazy, what are you doing?! Hey! Hey, you're stealing my space!",GEORGE,39,3
19,"No no no, he's not getting away with this.",GEORGE,39,3
20,"Hey, what are you doing?",GEORGE,39,3
21,"You can't do that, you can't just sneak in from the back like that.",GEORGE,39,3
22,"Well if you didn't think I was parking, why did you put it in head first?",GEORGE,39,3
23,I was in the middle of a conversation.,GEORGE,39,3
24,The point is I was here first.,GEORGE,39,3
25,But I'm backing in! You can't put it in head first!,GEORGE,39,3
26,Are you gonna move the car?,GEORGE,39,3
27,Jerk!,GEORGE,39,3
28,Do you believe this guy?,GEORGE,39,3
29,"I am not putting it in a garage, it's my space.",GEORGE,39,3
30,Are you coming back down?,GEORGE,39,3
31,"Alright, just make sure he reserves the good chair for me. Wait, what are you gonna tell him about the clanking noise in the car?",GEORGE,39,3
32,"Oh, come on, you're good at this.",GEORGE,39,3
33,"I don't know, I don't know, you'll think of something.",GEORGE,39,3
34,Hey!,GEORGE,39,3
35,"Yeah, I'm fine.",GEORGE,39,3
36,What?,GEORGE,39,3
37,"What, you know Jerry?",GEORGE,39,3
38,How do you know him?,GEORGE,39,3
39,"Because I know him too, and probably a lot better than you.",GEORGE,39,3
40,"What, you know Kramer?!",GEORGE,39,3
41,And you're watching the fight at Jerry's?,GEORGE,39,3
42,Oh great.,GEORGE,39,3
43,It's my space!,GEORGE,39,3
44,I'll die out here.,GEORGE,39,3
45,"Oh, come on.",GEORGE,39,3
46,"Me? You see what he did here, you see how he tried to sneak into my space?",GEORGE,39,3
47,You only went in front first 'cause you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!,GEORGE,39,3
48,You've got a prayer.,GEORGE,39,3
49,Did you talk to him?,GEORGE,39,3
50,You told him? What did you tell him?,GEORGE,39,3
51,"I don't believe it, what did you say?",GEORGE,39,3
52,A pack of teenagers?,GEORGE,39,3
53,"You are a genius, it's as simple as that.",GEORGE,39,3
54,Oh great.,GEORGE,39,3
55,Well I didn't know you wanted to go to the flea market.,GEORGE,39,3
56,"Hey, who's talking to you?",GEORGE,39,3
57,What? Every time I leave my house now I have to call everybody I know and ask them if they want to do what I'm doing?,GEORGE,39,3
58,"Great move, telling him, by the way, real smart move.",GEORGE,39,3
59,"Judgement, Jerry, judgement! You exercised no judgement.",GEORGE,39,3
60,"Yeah, I'm sorry.",GEORGE,39,3
61,"What was wrong with that sorry? It was a good sorry. Jerry, was that a good sorry?",GEORGE,39,3
62,You heard the man. I guess you gotta be moving your car.,GEORGE,39,3
63,Yeah.,GEORGE,39,3
64,Uh huh.,GEORGE,39,3
65,"Well, you know, It's interesting, you know, under that pressure, what you're capable of.",GEORGE,39,3
66,I learned a lot about myself.,GEORGE,39,3
67,"I couldn't help it! Elaine moved the mirror, I got discombobulated.",GEORGE,39,3
68,"No no, I never said I was a good driver, I said I was a good parker.",GEORGE,39,3
69,"Parker, I never said driver, I said parker, a great parker.",GEORGE,39,3
70,"No no no, that's in the right position.",GEORGE,39,3
71,"No you weren't. Stop there, that's fine.",GEORGE,39,3
72,Do you?,GEORGE,39,3
73,"Sid, it's completely his fault.",GEORGE,39,3
74,Don't do it!,GEORGE,39,3
75,"Yes! I'm not giving him the satisfaction, it's my space.",GEORGE,39,3
76,"No no, this is a matter of principle. That would just be saying that anybody could just pull into any parking space any way they want. Well I'm making a stand here. I'm saying *no* to head first parking. I'm not putting up with that. We put up with too much crap in this city, we're not putting up with head first parking.",GEORGE,39,3
77,So you're against me now?,GEORGE,39,3
78,He's right. never.,GEORGE,39,3
79,When do you ever have ten car lengths?,GEORGE,39,3
80,Oh please.,GEORGE,39,3
81,"Oh, this guy tried to sneak into my space.",GEORGE,39,3
82,"Well, thank you for your support.",GEORGE,39,3
83,Really? You like it? I got it at a flea market today.,GEORGE,39,3
84,"Yeah, thanks.",GEORGE,39,3
85,"No! It, uh, it wouldn't fit you.",GEORGE,39,3
86,"No! Get out of here, Newman.",GEORGE,39,3
87,"No, Newman, stop it.",GEORGE,39,3
88,I don't want him to!,GEORGE,39,3
89,"You wanna see?! (pulling off the hat to reveal the bald pate) There! There it is! (turning to Newman) Alright, here! You wanna try on the hat?! Here! Try on the hat!",GEORGE,39,3
90,"Alright, just keep the hat!",GEORGE,39,3
91,I'm not going if he's going.,GEORGE,39,3
92,"Officer, could I just explain something to you?",GEORGE,39,3
93,"Officer, he can't pull in head first.",GEORGE,39,3
94,"Well, you're gonna have to go to the bathroom!",GEORGE,39,3
95,I don't have a job!,GEORGE,39,3
0,"Ten bucks, how can you go wrong?",ELAINE,39,3
1,"You should have lived in the twenties and thirties, you know men wore hats all the time then.",ELAINE,39,3
2,"Well, you can wear a hat all the time now. Who's stopping you?",ELAINE,39,3
3,Are you sure you like these sunglasses?,ELAINE,39,3
4,Of course I hear that.,ELAINE,39,3
5,I wanted to check out my sunglasses.,ELAINE,39,3
6,"Oh yeah, blame it on me because you can't drive, George.",ELAINE,39,3
7,Yeah.,ELAINE,39,3
8,"No, I really don't.",ELAINE,39,3
9,I'm sure you could.,ELAINE,39,3
10,I don't know.,ELAINE,39,3
11,"Oh, you're never gonna find a space on Jerry's block, just put it in a garage.",ELAINE,39,3
12,"Oh come on, George, please put it in a garage. I don't want to spend an hour looking for a space.",ELAINE,39,3
13,Why?,ELAINE,39,3

26,"Oh god. Oh, Jerry it was so terrible what we just went through on the way home. (pouring a big shot of scotch) You wouldn't believe it. (pushing a bag of chips off the counter)",ELAINE,39,3
27,"(after pouring the shot in the sink while Jerry was distracted and pretending to have downed it) Okay. Now listen. We were at the toll booth at the Henry Hudson Parkway, okay?! And there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?! And for some reason, I don't know, they just started to taunt us! And so then we payed the toll, and then we went through, and then they started to follow us, alright?! So George tries to lose them, and, and, but they were in this really like a souped up car, you know?! And so he turned off the road really suddenly and the car was on two wheels and I was just screaming! And then, George is such a great driver.",ELAINE,39,3
28,"Oh, he is fantastic! And then they fired a gun right up in the air.",ELAINE,39,3

42,I told him a pack of teenagers in a convertible were terrorizing us and they followed us into the city.,ELAINE,39,3
43,"Yeah, by the time I got to the end of the story, he was to relieved that we were alive he couldn't care less about the car.",ELAINE,39,3
44,"What can I say, you know? It's a gift. I only wish I could teach it but, you know it's inborn.",ELAINE,39,3

51,Right.,ELAINE,39,3
52,"Oh, like you've ever been bobulated.",ELAINE,39,3
53,Why don't you just flip a coin already?,ELAINE,39,3

55,What?,ELAINE,39,3
56,He thinks you're a phony?,ELAINE,39,3
57,"Oh, you have to say something.",ELAINE,39,3
58,You gotta open the vault.,ELAINE,39,3
59,Open your vault.,ELAINE,39,3
60,You have no choice.,ELAINE,39,3
61,It depends on who's going. (to George) Are you going?,ELAINE,39,3
62,Well I don't want to go if Jerry's not going.,ELAINE,39,3
0,"Hey. I got some bad news for you, buddy. I think your car got stolen again.",KRAMER,39,3

60,Do you wanna fight?,JERRY,40,3
61,"Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could get mine.",JERRY,40,3
62,What's that?,JERRY,40,3

24,"Well, you can get 'em back.",KRAMER,40,3
25,"Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment? That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house, it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes. I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the darkness...like you.",KRAMER,40,3

66,"That's what she says. I say, listen. It was an old cat. It died of natural causes. So get this, now she tells me that I gotta buy her a brand new cat. I say listen, honey. First of all, it was a pretty old cat. I'm not gonna buy you a brand new cat to replace an old dying cat. And second of all, I go out to the garbage, I find you a new cat in fifteen seconds. I say, you show me an autopsy report that says this cat died of starvation, I spring for a new cat. So she says something to me, like, uh, I dunno, get the hell out of here, and she breaks up with me. Now don't you think that would be a great case on L.A. Law?",GEORGE,41,4
67,I don't wanna tell you how to run your show.,GEORGE,41,4

34,You have a girlfriend?,JERRY,43,4
35,I never remember you with a girl.,JERRY,43,4

69,What do you mean you don't think so?,JERRY,43,4
70,I don't understand. What don't you like about it?,JERRY,43,4
71,Why not?,JERRY,43,4
72,You're my neighbor. There's got to be a character based on you.,JERRY,43,4
73,I don't understand what the big deal is.,JERRY,43,4
74,Whatever you want.,JERRY,43,4
75,You can't play Kramer.,JERRY,43,4

113,"Oh, Pepe. Yeah, Pepe. And, uh, he was making tamales.",JERRY,43,4
114,"Well, we've thought about this in a variety of ways. But the basic idea is I will play myself-",JERRY,43,4
115,Go ahead.,JERRY,43,4
116,"(To George) Well, it's not about nothing.",JERRY,43,4
117,"Well, maybe in philosophy. But, even nothing is something.",JERRY,43,4
118,"..Well, as I was saying, I would play myself, and, as a comedian, living in New York, I have a friend, a neighbor, and an ex-girlfriend, which is all true.",JERRY,43,4

122,(To Russell) How about this: I manage a circus..,JERRY,43,4
123,"I don't even want to talk about it anymore. What were you thinking? What was going on in your mind? Artistic integrity? Where, where did you come up with that? You're not artistic and you have no integrity. You know you really need some help. A regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you. You need to go to like Vienna or something. You know what I mean? You need to get involved at the University level. Like where Freud studied and have all those people looking at you and checking up on you. That's the kind of help you need. Not the once a week for eighty bucks. No. You need a team. A team of psychiatrists working round the clock thinking about you, having conferences, observing you, like the way they did with the Elephant Man. That's what I'm talking about because that's the only way you're going to get better.",JERRY,43,4
124,Hold it. I really want to be clear about this. Are you talking about the woman in the meeting? Is that the woman you're talking about?,JERRY,43,4

129,"Well we were standing uh, inn the waiting area there, and you know how Devola is. He's all, ... (buzzer)",JERRY,43,4
130,"And so, uh I felt very uncomfortable with him and you know I just blurted out something about your party.",JERRY,43,4
131,"Well, I didn't know that you didn't invite him.",JERRY,43,4
132,"I just a ssumed, ...",JERRY,43,4
133,Of course. How are you?,JERRY,43,4
134,Tell me what?,JERRY,43,4
135,"Uh, sorry, Excuse me one second. Hello.",JERRY,43,4

143,Look just because Kramer vomited on her doesn't mean the deal is dead.,JERRY,43,4
144,"Vommiting is not a deal breaker. If Hitler had vommited on Chamberlin, Chamberlind still would have given him Chekoslovakia.",JERRY,43,4
145,What happened to you?,JERRY,43,4
146,What? Devola? See I told you this guy is crazy. I can't believe this. What happened?,JERRY,43,4

148,"Wow, Newman's helmet.",JERRY,43,4
149,"Me, why?",JERRY,43,4
150,What does he want from me? I didn't do anything. See this is all Elaine's fault. She took off to Europe with his psychiatrist. He probably can't get his medication. Now I got some nut after me.,JERRY,43,4
0,What did they do for toilet paper in the civil war?,GEORGE,43,4
1,I wonder what toilet paper was loike in the 1860's. Did they carry it in rolls in their duffle bags?,GEORGE,43,4
2,What?,GEORGE,43,4
3,"All right, so what did they do?",GEORGE,43,4
4,Well I think it would be nice if there was some kind of historical record of it.,GEORGE,43,4

12,"Come on, how hard is that? Look at all the junk that's on TV. You want an idea? Here's an idea. You coach gymnastics team in high school. And you're married. And your son's not interested in gymnastics and you're pushing him into gymnastics.",GEORGE,43,4
13,Because you're a gymnastics teacher. It's only natural.,GEORGE,43,4

18,"I know, but antiques are very popular right now.",GEORGE,43,4
19,"Oh yeah, like you know.",GEORGE,43,4
20,Really?,GEORGE,43,4
21,I can't believe she got involved with a shrink.,GEORGE,43,4

2,"So, what are you guys doin' this weekend?",KRAMER,47,4
3,Because I'm going to be playing golf at the Westchester country club. Mmh.,KRAMER,47,4
4,"Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private. But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St. -- I gave him one of these Cubans and he invites me up to play a free round ... then he says anytime I lay one of these babies on him it's going to be the same deal. Ha ha. Idn't that beautiful.",KRAMER,47,4

12,"Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer. Yeah, I'm the next door neighbor. Aw, well you know, ah Jerry's left, uh, uh, But listen, ah, see ah, my golf game got canceled. Uh, I'm thinkin' of going up myself... They got pies and ah, I got the directions right here.",KRAMER,47,4
13,So then I drive all the way up to the country club and then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind if I smoke?,KRAMER,47,4
14,"These are Cubans. (IN FAKE SPANISH) Maria, poquendo los scientos de estes con gleam.",KRAMER,47,4

1,"""We're""? What do you mean, ""We're""?",JERRY,48,4
2,You're meetin' the father for the first time?,JERRY,48,4
3,"(Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.",JERRY,48,4
4,"(Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it: Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban cigars..",JERRY,48,4
5,"No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..",JERRY,48,4
6,"(Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation) It's very comical..",JERRY,48,4
7,"(Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's the day.",JERRY,48,4
8,"(Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a cabin.",JERRY,48,4
9,"(Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.",JERRY,48,4
10,"What, you got a problem with the pen now?",JERRY,48,4
11,"Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down) NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I, Scene A.",JERRY,48,4
12,"(Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.",JERRY,48,4
13,"No, no thank you.",JERRY,48,4
14,"Act I, Scene A..",JERRY,48,4
15,"(Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh, yeah. I can hold. (To George) Every time I call I gotta chit-chat with her assistant for, like, twenty minutes. (Back into the phone) Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen, I'm at a pay phone, and there's lots of people here waiting to use it. (Yelling out for believability) I'll be off in a minute! (To Sandra) Yeah, could you just put me through to Elaine? Okay, thanks! (He turns to George) Are you thinking of ideas? (George, picking his teeth with his finger, is absorbed into the television. He seems to not even notice Jerry) Listen, Elaine, is there any way I could get through to you directly? Every time I call Sandra bends my ear for, like, twenty minutes. (Pause) So we're on for later?",JERRY,48,4
16,"Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready to work)",JERRY,48,4
17,Yeah.,JERRY,48,4
18,"Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.",JERRY,48,4
19,Here we go.,JERRY,48,4
20,"Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's with you?",JERRY,48,4
21,Why?,JERRY,48,4
22,Yeah.,JERRY,48,4
23,What?!,JERRY,48,4
24,(Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the script?,JERRY,48,4
25,"Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm responsible for this woman's quitting. Oh, this is unbelievable!",JERRY,48,4
26,"(Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?",JERRY,48,4
27,"(Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her hand in a bowl of popcorn - grabbing a fistful) Listen, I - I just want to tell you, (Jerry sternly grabs Elaine's hand - forcing her to drop the popcorn, then shoves her hand away. Elaine sits back like a scolded child) There's been a terrible misunderstanding: See, I told Elaine that, uh, it was a real treat talking to you on the phone, and she thought I was being sarcastic, you know, 'cause I'm a comedian and all. She thought I meant (Deeply sarcastic) ""Yeah, it was a real treat talking to her on the phone."" (Back to normal) You know, but I was really being sincere.. No, of course I like you.. Tonight? ..Um, uh, hold on a second. (To Elaine, whispering) Now she wants to have a drink with me. (Elaine mouths out ""Just go"" while making gestures. Jerry, again, gives in. Back on the phone) Yeah, I think I can.. Um.. yeah, I know where that is.. Ok.. uh, I'll see you there. Okay, bye. (Hangs up, peeved) Now I gotta have a drink with her.",JERRY,48,4
28,What?!,JERRY,48,4
29,What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was just trying to keep up!,JERRY,48,4
30,Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.,JERRY,48,4
31,(Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her) You - you said much sicker things than me.,JERRY,48,4
32,I really think you're making too much of this.,JERRY,48,4
33,Let me walk you to a cab.,JERRY,48,4
34,"I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us, and that'll be the end of it.",JERRY,48,4
35,"(Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really don't.",JERRY,48,4
36,"So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she starts rubbing my leg.",JERRY,48,4
37,(Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching your leg?,JERRY,48,4
38,"I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the hand, and I'm thinking, ""That hand should not be on my leg."" But I can't make my brain to get my mouth to say the words, ""Would you mind?!""",JERRY,48,4
39,"I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..",JERRY,48,4
40,So we go back to my apartment..,JERRY,48,4
41,"So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others from hearing) and, uh, she starts with the dirty talking.",JERRY,48,4
42,"(Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..",JERRY,48,4
43,Typical things.,JERRY,48,4
44,"She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup bottle - ketchup squirts out and files off-screen. George reacts deeply)",JERRY,48,4
45,..And then she starts talking about her panties.,JERRY,48,4
46,So I said something.,JERRY,48,4
47,"(Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep up.",JERRY,48,4
48,"Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I said, ""You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?""",JERRY,48,4
49,(Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.,JERRY,48,4
50,She flipped out! Just left.,JERRY,48,4
51,"Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing. And she's never let me hear the end of it.",JERRY,48,4
52,"She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect money to pay for the check) Hey, so, Susan's father took that news pretty hard, huh?",JERRY,48,4
53,I guess he failed to see the humor in it.,JERRY,48,4
54,"(Getting up) Alright, big work day.",JERRY,48,4
55,Let's go.,JERRY,48,4
56,Right now.,JERRY,48,4
57,You and me.,JERRY,48,4
58,Alright.,JERRY,48,4
59,"(Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go ""Hi"", and I go, ""Hello."" Now.. we need something here..",JERRY,48,4
60,"Come in, we're taking a break.",JERRY,48,4
61,Yeah!,JERRY,48,4
62,"(Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's get it together.. (Through intercom) Yeah?",JERRY,48,4
63,C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine),JERRY,48,4
64,"(Agreeing) Yeah, we should.",JERRY,48,4
65,"Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?",JERRY,48,4
66,Oh.,JERRY,48,4
67,What?,JERRY,48,4
68,"Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think about it - there's no two ways about it.",JERRY,48,4
69,Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her! We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks that this isn't anybody you should be talking to.,JERRY,48,4
70,Yes.,JERRY,48,4
71,"Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy here working on the script, I'd do it myself.",JERRY,48,4
72,Hi.,JERRY,48,4
73,"Ah, just - takin' a little break.",JERRY,48,4
74,(Looking at his watch ) Yeah..,JERRY,48,4
75,Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.,JERRY,48,4
76,Yeah.,JERRY,48,4
77,"Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly exiting) time.",JERRY,48,4
78,(Waving good bye) We'll see ya.,JERRY,48,4
79,"Alright, let's go.",JERRY,48,4
80,Right now.,JERRY,48,4
81,You and me.,JERRY,48,4
82,No foolin',JERRY,48,4
83,"(Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in, you say ""Hi"", and I say ""Hello"".",JERRY,48,4
84,"Yeah.. how about this: I say ""How's it goin'?""",JERRY,48,4
85,"(Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that line?",JERRY,48,4
86,Did you write it down?,JERRY,48,4
87,Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine),JERRY,48,4
88,What?!,JERRY,48,4
89,What?! How?,JERRY,48,4
90,What calls?!,JERRY,48,4
91,"Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?",JERRY,48,4
92,So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about anything?,JERRY,48,4
93,(Smiling to himself) Beautiful.,JERRY,48,4
94,"Oh, no, not beautiful.",JERRY,48,4
95,"Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.",JERRY,48,4
96,"(Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-",JERRY,48,4
97,"(Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell smoke?",JERRY,48,4
98,"Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.",JERRY,48,4
99,"Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..",JERRY,48,4
100,"Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the check to Elaine) look, we gotta get back to work. We just had a big breakthrough here.",JERRY,48,4
101,(Moving back into the living room) Okay.,JERRY,48,4
0,No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.,GEORGE,48,4
1,Susan wants me to be there.,GEORGE,48,4
2,(Reluctantly) Yeah.,GEORGE,48,4
3,I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!,GEORGE,48,4
4,"Yeah, I know what happened.",GEORGE,48,4
5,(Getting frustrated) I know.,GEORGE,48,4
6,"Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a lot on my mind.",GEORGE,48,4
7,"(Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the worst he could do? So you burn a cabin down..",GEORGE,48,4
8,We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.,GEORGE,48,4
9,"(Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics? What, d'ja get, bics?",GEORGE,48,4
10,"Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.",GEORGE,48,4
11,"(Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?",GEORGE,48,4
12,(Offering) Drink?,GEORGE,48,4
13,"(Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.",GEORGE,48,4
14,Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?,GEORGE,48,4
15,"Alright, here we go. You got it?",GEORGE,48,4
16,Here we go.,GEORGE,48,4
17,"(Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful. Now, what do I say?",GEORGE,48,4
18,"Alright, let's go.",GEORGE,48,4
19,"yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something here. We're trying to do a little work..",GEORGE,48,4
20,"What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars after you burned down his cabin!",GEORGE,48,4
21,"Kramer, please.",GEORGE,48,4
22,"Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them some place else.",GEORGE,48,4
23,(Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.,GEORGE,48,4
24,"Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want to leave myself plenty of time.",GEORGE,48,4
25,I think we got a bite on it. (Exits),GEORGE,48,4
26,"Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling in virtual anonymity. I mean..",GEORGE,48,4
27,"Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin' 'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.",GEORGE,48,4
28,(Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild. (Susan and George both laugh),GEORGE,48,4
29,"Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what is the point of opening your mouth and going ""Ha, ha!""? What is that? ""Ha, ha!""?",GEORGE,48,4
30,"(Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin.. well, (Clears throat)",GEORGE,48,4
31,"The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?",GEORGE,48,4
32,(Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress of solitude.,GEORGE,48,4

23,"Do I think you're a clown? No, not if it?s bad to be a clown, if it?s bad to be a clown then you are definitely not a clown. But if its good to be a clown then, you know, I would have to rethink the whole thing.",ELAINE,49,4
24,"Oh, like any man would ever look at me, come on, I?m gonna... get out of here.",ELAINE,49,4
25,"Se, now that?s terrible, that is not a nice thing to do at all, I don?t know how this Paliachi thing turns out but you know I would assume that there is big big trouble for that clown",ELAINE,49,4
26,"Cherry Binaca, it?s new.",ELAINE,49,4
27,It's like I didn't even know him. He's like a totally different person.,ELAINE,49,4
28,I guarantee they don't sell either one of those tickets.,ELAINE,49,4
29,"Oh, yeah, when George made that bad toast!",ELAINE,49,4
30,"Oh yeah, the curse toast.",ELAINE,49,4
31,Me too,ELAINE,49,4
32,How do you know his name?,ELAINE,49,4
33,I never told you his name.,ELAINE,49,4
34,"Wait a second, who are we talking about here?",ELAINE,49,4
35,"Right, Joe Divola",ELAINE,49,4
36,"I've been out with him three times, I should know the mans name.",ELAINE,49,4
37,Is he stalking you? are you kidding me?,ELAINE,49,4
38,"Oh, Jerry, why didn't you tell me his name! Oh my god, he accused me of seeing someone else, he said tell me his name, he said tell me his name!!",ELAINE,49,4
39,"Oooohh, what about me!",ELAINE,49,4

41,"You know, it is so sad, all your knowledge of high culture comes from bugs bunny cartoons.",ELAINE,49,4

3,"Jerry, you don't understand, that?s the way they talk in Italy, they sing to one another. Kramer starts to sing in bad Italian.",KRAMER,49,4
4,"That?s the way it was, you know. You listen to the language, its got that sing songy quality. It?s the language Jerry, the language",KRAMER,49,4
5,"Well its, uh, well its too hard to keep up, you know, they were tired.",KRAMER,49,4
6,Better get that,KRAMER,49,4

53,Yeah,KRAMER,49,4
54,Some nut in a clown suit!,KRAMER,49,4
0,We're dead.,JERRY,50,4
1,We are dead.,JERRY,50,4
2,All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with something and we didn't do anything.,JERRY,50,4
3,Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went skiing?,JERRY,50,4
4,I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.,JERRY,50,4
5,So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.,JERRY,50,4
6,"Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the one on the right. She's in the closet business.",JERRY,50,4
7,What is it your business?,JERRY,50,4
8,She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize your closet space. She looked into my closet.,JERRY,50,4
9,Yeah.,JERRY,50,4
10,"So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me. What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.",JERRY,50,4
11,"George, Marla.",JERRY,50,4
12,Stacey.,JERRY,50,4
13,"George, Stacey.",JERRY,50,4
14,George.,JERRY,50,4
15,Trip to Berlin?,JERRY,50,4
16,"Oh, right, right.",JERRY,50,4
17,"Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN, and they covered it so well I thought, ""Why knock my brains out?""",JERRY,50,4
18,Really?,JERRY,50,4
19,"Oh, did he like it?",JERRY,50,4
20,"So, are you gonna go out with her?",JERRY,50,4
21,What about Susan?,JERRY,50,4
22,Depends.,JERRY,50,4
23,On many factors.,JERRY,50,4
24,"Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone call frequency? Are you on a daily?",JERRY,50,4
25,"What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out, or is a date implied?",JERRY,50,4
26,She got anything in your medicine cabinet?,JERRY,50,4
27,Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your house?,JERRY,50,4
28,"Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.",JERRY,50,4
29,You got yourself a girlfriend.,JERRY,50,4
30,"I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help you out, but...",JERRY,50,4
31,You're going to make a good father someday.,JERRY,50,4
32,Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?,JERRY,50,4
33,"The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.",JERRY,50,4
34,"Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna pick us up?",JERRY,50,4
35,"you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship. But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?",JERRY,50,4
36,"(sarcastically) Oh, yeah.",JERRY,50,4
37,This is your plan?,JERRY,50,4
38,I don't think you are.,JERRY,50,4
39,"Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.",JERRY,50,4
40,I don't think I am.,JERRY,50,4
41,Try me.,JERRY,50,4
42,Everything?,JERRY,50,4
43,"You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?",JERRY,50,4
44,What are you doing?,JERRY,50,4
45,No.,JERRY,50,4
46,This is not a good time.,JERRY,50,4
47,What did you have to give your TV away to George for?,JERRY,50,4
48,"Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters from other room)",JERRY,50,4
49,"Marla, Kramer.",JERRY,50,4
50,Why don't you go out? It's nice out.,JERRY,50,4
51,There's weather.,JERRY,50,4
52,I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.,JERRY,50,4
53,I don't know.,JERRY,50,4
54,Kramer... (points to Marla),JERRY,50,4
55,So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.,JERRY,50,4
56,"Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.",JERRY,50,4
57,Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?,JERRY,50,4
58,"Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine. I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?",JERRY,50,4
59,Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.,JERRY,50,4
60,Snapple?,JERRY,50,4
61,Go on.,JERRY,50,4
62,Yes.,JERRY,50,4
63,Yeah.,JERRY,50,4
64,"Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.",JERRY,50,4
65,"Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five dollars to see Havana.",JERRY,50,4
66,I like that thing in your hair there.,JERRY,50,4
67,So we'll talk about the hooks then?,JERRY,50,4
68,"She's a virgin, she just told me.",JERRY,50,4
69,Well it's not like spotting a toupee.,JERRY,50,4
70,"No, no, I mean...",JERRY,50,4
71,"Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?",JERRY,50,4
72,A virgin.,JERRY,50,4
73,"I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's so sexy.",JERRY,50,4
74,"You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have any of that Lewis and Clark in you.",JERRY,50,4
75,"Yeah, me too.",JERRY,50,4
76,"All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let me know what it is and I'll order for you.",JERRY,50,4
77,"All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the meeting.",JERRY,50,4
78,"Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.",JERRY,50,4
79,Yeah.,JERRY,50,4
80,Your butler?,JERRY,50,4
81,What about me?,JERRY,50,4
82,"(Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard. Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are at the door) Ping, what happened?",JERRY,50,4
83,What happened?,JERRY,50,4
84,Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?,JERRY,50,4
85,"Yeah, here.",JERRY,50,4
86,(To George) You're givin' him back that TV.,JERRY,50,4
87,"A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light, and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business. I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business? It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression, you're outta the business!",JERRY,50,4
88,What do you mean? They know we're here.,JERRY,50,4
89,"No, no, would you get up?",JERRY,50,4
90,No.,JERRY,50,4
91,What?,JERRY,50,4
92,"Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry enters meeting)",JERRY,50,4
93,"Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.",JERRY,50,4
94,"Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?",JERRY,50,4
95,"Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)",JERRY,50,4
96,"Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.",JERRY,50,4
97,"Yeah, he just walked by.",JERRY,50,4
98,"Yeah, good idea.",JERRY,50,4
99,"Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.",JERRY,50,4
100,"Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin' there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry... and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?",JERRY,50,4
101,"Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house, he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of those big neck collars.",JERRY,50,4
102,"Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.",JERRY,50,4
103,"So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?",JERRY,50,4
104,Would you give him the TV back?,JERRY,50,4
105,Why did he fire her?,JERRY,50,4
106,You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered. You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.,JERRY,50,4
107,You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.,JERRY,50,4
108,Couple of interviews.,JERRY,50,4
109,What? Leave? Where? Why?,JERRY,50,4
110,Why would I leave? This is my apartment.,JERRY,50,4
111,Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?,JERRY,50,4
112,"Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was in bad shape.",JERRY,50,4
113,What else did you say to her?,JERRY,50,4
114,"More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.",JERRY,50,4
115,What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with you?,JERRY,50,4
116,I was trying to be.,JERRY,50,4
117,"Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break up with him? They had a good thing going.",JERRY,50,4
0,We're not dead.,GEORGE,50,4
1,Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.,GEORGE,50,4
2,So we'll do it tomorrow.,GEORGE,50,4
3,About six years ago.,GEORGE,50,4
4,Women like skiers.,GEORGE,50,4
5,Yeah. Right.,GEORGE,50,4
6,The closet business? What's the closet business?,GEORGE,50,4
7,I'm interested.,GEORGE,50,4
8,So you thought she was good looking and figured this would be a good way to meet her.,GEORGE,50,4
9,Yeah. So what happened?,GEORGE,50,4
10,Marla.,GEORGE,50,4
11,Stacey.,GEORGE,50,4
12,Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over to Stacey),GEORGE,50,4
13,"Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story before we can write.",GEORGE,50,4
14,Not a bad way to make a buck.,GEORGE,50,4
15,"Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But, it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)",GEORGE,50,4
16,I might.,GEORGE,50,4
17,What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody else?,GEORGE,50,4
18,Depends on what?,GEORGE,50,4
19,Like what?,GEORGE,50,4
20,No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.,GEORGE,50,4
21,Implied.,GEORGE,50,4
22,There might be some moisturizer.,GEORGE,50,4
23,(Pause) Yeah.,GEORGE,50,4
24,What?,GEORGE,50,4
25,"Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?",GEORGE,50,4
26,"Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I have a good answer to the question, ""What do you do?"" and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend, you just want more girlfriends.",GEORGE,50,4
27,"Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right, all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.",GEORGE,50,4
28,"No, what?",GEORGE,50,4
29,Why? What do you mean?,GEORGE,50,4
30,"Oh, right. Oh no, man.",GEORGE,50,4
31,"Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this? What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.",GEORGE,50,4
32,"Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time. Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC. I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.",GEORGE,50,4
33,"No, no. I'm just thinking.",GEORGE,50,4
34,It's George.,GEORGE,50,4
35,She's a virgin?,GEORGE,50,4
36,Wow. So what're you gonna do?,GEORGE,50,4
37,"I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.",GEORGE,50,4
38,"You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks in fridge) I'm really hungry.",GEORGE,50,4
39,We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?,GEORGE,50,4
40,What do you want?,GEORGE,50,4
41,I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes and we'll just share 'em.,GEORGE,50,4
42,I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.,GEORGE,50,4
43,It's a broad noodle.,GEORGE,50,4
44,It's a big flat noodle.,GEORGE,50,4
45,What kind of noodle do you want?,GEORGE,50,4
46,"All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have to have any.",GEORGE,50,4
47,Fine.,GEORGE,50,4
48,Where's the food? What happened to Ping?,GEORGE,50,4
49,"Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist is uninsured, you with me?",GEORGE,50,4
50,"My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees that he becomes my butler.",GEORGE,50,4
51,"Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.",GEORGE,50,4
52,"Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's door)",GEORGE,50,4
53,Something happened to the food?,GEORGE,50,4
54,(After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved was the pea pods? (Kramer enters),GEORGE,50,4
55,He dropped it.,GEORGE,50,4
56,(To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?,GEORGE,50,4
57,"All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.",GEORGE,50,4
58,"I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I can't believe, my back.",GEORGE,50,4
59,"I can do this, Jerry.",GEORGE,50,4
60,"All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor family.",GEORGE,50,4
61,That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk by. I'll be right back. (He exits),GEORGE,50,4
62,"You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?",GEORGE,50,4
63,"Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea, that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought I was getting the butler.",GEORGE,50,4
64,"No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time I should probably break the Prozacs in half.",GEORGE,50,4
65,I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He calls Susan),GEORGE,50,4
66,"Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?",GEORGE,50,4
67,Fired? Why?,GEORGE,50,4
68,But I had no... I didn't realize.,GEORGE,50,4
69,I just feel terrible This is just terrible.,GEORGE,50,4
70,"(Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her! This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!",GEORGE,50,4
71,"Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out, he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!",GEORGE,50,4
72,What?,GEORGE,50,4
73,Another job?,GEORGE,50,4
74,"Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think I'm out, they pull me back in.",GEORGE,50,4
75,"What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.",GEORGE,50,4
0,It's me.,ELAINE,50,4

18,"So, you're still master of your domain.",KRAMER,51,4
19,"Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?",KRAMER,51,4
20,"Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked, and you want to tell her to stop?! That's the dumbest thing I ever heard! I mean, think comprehens- I'm not gonna let you do it.",KRAMER,51,4
21,"(Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys, looking through our bedroom windows, we would think: ""Why can't there be a woman out there, taking her clothes off?"" And now that wish's come true, and you want to (Makes a noise) throw it away?!",KRAMER,51,4

1,"I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the window doesn't work, the radio doesn't work... and it smells like a cheap hooker... [pause] Or is that you?",JERRY,52,4
2,"So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin' me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my gig, you got to see your sister...",JERRY,52,4
3,And here's the beauty--,JERRY,52,4
4,George is pickin' us up at the airport.,JERRY,52,4
5,You know that awning outside my building?,JERRY,52,4
6,"He's always bragging about his vertical leap, so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.",JERRY,52,4
7,"He didn't come within two feet of the thing. He's wavin at it... So, I told him if he picks us up at the airport, he wouldn't have to pay me anything.",JERRY,52,4
8,"Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...",JERRY,52,4
9,Hey! Wait up!,JERRY,52,4

18,"C'mon, seriously...",JERRY,52,4
19,"All right, look, we're late. Thank you very much...",JERRY,52,4
20,"You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl. 'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run like a man! Get your knees up!",JERRY,52,4

33,"Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank... *you*!",JERRY,52,4
34,Oh my...,JERRY,52,4
35,Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good thing they gave you that washcloth to cover yourself up... What is this an ad for?,JERRY,52,4
36,Uh-huh...,JERRY,52,4
37,Oh my... that *is* refreshing...,JERRY,52,4
38,"Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them on her] May I?",JERRY,52,4
39,"Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.",JERRY,52,4
40,"Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom? It's like an English garden in there.",JERRY,52,4
41,I thought I smelled lilac.,JERRY,52,4
42,"Oh, saffron! That sounds good.",JERRY,52,4
43,"Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge on the bottom-- y'see? That enables you to control your fudge distribution as you're eatin' your ice cream.",JERRY,52,4
44,Thank you...,JERRY,52,4
45,More everything!,JERRY,52,4
46,"What is all the racket back there? You know, you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put up with. [To attendant] What is going on?",JERRY,52,4
47,"Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is, that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.",JERRY,52,4
48,Couldn't be...,JERRY,52,4
49,"Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere... I got my bags, I'm ready to go.",JERRY,52,4

52,Yeah. Where's George?,JERRY,52,4
0,"Hey, thanks for coming with me.",GEORGE,52,4
1,I confused it with another awning.,GEORGE,52,4
2,"We're perfect. I timed this out so we would pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off the plane, pick up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal as we roll up. I tell you, it's a thing of beauty. I can not express to you the feeling I get from a perfect airport pickup. (starts looking around) What's going on? What are you doing? The Long Island Expressway? What are you getting on the Long Island Expressway for? Do you know what the traffic will be like? This is a suicide mission!",GEORGE,52,4
3,"Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand Central, the Van Wyck! You destroyed my whole timing!",GEORGE,52,4
4,Do you know what happens if I miss him? I don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...,GEORGE,52,4
5,Really?,GEORGE,52,4
6,The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest sucker deal in retail. Do you know how much duty is?,GEORGE,52,4
7,"Yeah, ""duty"". Do you know how much duty is?",GEORGE,52,4
8,Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...,GEORGE,52,4
9,I like to stop at the duty free shop.,GEORGE,52,4
10,They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!,GEORGE,52,4
11,"Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.",GEORGE,52,4
12,Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick up? I was here!,GEORGE,52,4
13,No... What guy?,GEORGE,52,4
14,"Listen, you go over to the ticket counter, I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine. There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think he mentioned my name!",GEORGE,52,4
15,"Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.",GEORGE,52,4
16,"You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about me in this magazine!",GEORGE,52,4
17,Umm... No.,GEORGE,52,4
18,"But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles. Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too. Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that is!",GEORGE,52,4

20,My name is not mentioned in this blurb...,GEORGE,52,4
21,Who's Grossbard?,GEORGE,52,4
22,"Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty years ago...",GEORGE,52,4
23,"No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot* abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social contract. We... we must go forward... not back.",GEORGE,52,4
24,"Well, You're not gonna believe it...",GEORGE,52,4
25,The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy. We've got 45 minutes.,GEORGE,52,4
26,There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.,GEORGE,52,4
27,How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded the plane already.,GEORGE,52,4
28,My credit card?,GEORGE,52,4
29,I'm not gonna give you my card unless you tell me what it's for!,GEORGE,52,4
30,"What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.",GEORGE,52,4
31,This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one. I get frequent flyer miles with every purchase... Wait! Get two tickets. As long as your turning it in for a refund what's the difference? I'll get *double* the bonus miles.,GEORGE,52,4
32,Super Savers? Are they refundable!?,GEORGE,52,4
33,"You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!",GEORGE,52,4
34,Do you know how much this is going to cost me?,GEORGE,52,4
35,"Look, I'm gonna go to the bathroom...",GEORGE,52,4
36,(can't be heard but looks like) Kramer!,GEORGE,52,4
0,"Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo waaaah, waah, waaaah...",ELAINE,52,4
1,Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.,ELAINE,52,4
2,Gimme ten bucks and find out...,ELAINE,52,4

8,"Hey, how we doin' on time?",ELAINE,52,4
9,Hey! Wait up!,ELAINE,52,4
10,"Yeah, you want five?",ELAINE,52,4
11,You're giving him *ten* dollars?,ELAINE,52,4
12,That's a pretty big tip...,ELAINE,52,4
13,They don't get that much.,ELAINE,52,4
14,We can't ask him...,ELAINE,52,4
15,"Jerry, we don't have time for this...",ELAINE,52,4
16,What!?,ELAINE,52,4
17,*Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.,ELAINE,52,4
18,You got some nerve trying to take advantage of us...,ELAINE,52,4

30,Great... [To herself] Help me...,ELAINE,52,4
31,"Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself] Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.",ELAINE,52,4
32,"[To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug! Wake up! *Wake* *up*!! I can't hold it anymore! [To the slug out loud] Excuse me, I've gotta go to the bathroom...",ELAINE,52,4
33,[To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd he say?,ELAINE,52,4

36,"Well, nobody *told* me that!",ELAINE,52,4

38,I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's my meal?,ELAINE,52,4
39,"Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.",ELAINE,52,4
40,"Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food had been served to me.",ELAINE,52,4
41,Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I don't even know what a kosher meal is.,ELAINE,52,4

46,"No, but there was nobody sitting here...",ELAINE,52,4
47,"Oh, no, please, don't send me back there. Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods] Oh, you got *cookies*!",ELAINE,52,4
48,"Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the curtain to, ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here are getting *cookies*!",ELAINE,52,4

32,"No, of course not.",GEORGE,55,4
33,"Maybe you don't have to be so funny. I mean, would it kill you not to be so funny all the time? That's all I'm asking. This woman thinks I'm very funny. Now you're gonna be funny, so what am I gonna be? I'm gonna be a short bald guy with glasses who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.",GEORGE,55,4

46,He can't not be funny.,GEORGE,55,4
47,"Dark and disturbed? His whole life revolves around Superman and cereal. I convinced him to act like that so that you would think I was funnier. That's how disturbed I am! If you want disturbed, that's disturbed. You can't find sickness like that anywhere, you think sickness like that grows on trees? Nobody is sicker than me, nobody. He's pretending, I'm the genuine article.",GEORGE,55,4
48,"Yes! And I put him up to it, because I'm sick! I'm the one that needs help.",GEORGE,55,4

7,"Yeah, well, Joe Pepitone or not, I own the inside of that plate. So I throw one, you know, inside, you know, a little chin music, put him right on his pants.

8,"Oh yeah. Well, he throws down his bat, he comes racing up to the mound. Next thing, both benches are cleared, you know? A brouhaha breaks out between the guys in the camp, you know, and the old Yankee players, and as I'm trying to get Moose Skowron off of one of my teammates, you know, somebody pulls me from behind, you know, and I turned around and I popped him.

14,"Yeah, I know.",JERRY,56,4
15,"Well, there were too many people in the room, we couldn't keep track of everybody. George, and the butler, and...",JERRY,56,4
16,"Well, we tried. We couldn't. We didn't know how to, uh...(confessing) ...we couldn't write for a woman. We didn't know what you would say. Even right now, I'm sitting here, I know you're going to say something, I have no idea what it is.",JERRY,56,4
17,Something derogatory? (Gail enters the coffee shop and walks over to the booth.),JERRY,56,4
18,"Well, Gail Cunningham.",JERRY,56,4
19,Why?,JERRY,56,4
20,Are you sure?,JERRY,56,4
21,"Nothing. (Elaine grabs Jerry's sandwich and is about to take a bite.) Hey, where you goin' with that? Gimme that. (Takes back the sandwich.)",JERRY,56,4
22,"I took two bites, how am I finished? (Elaine coughs.) Plus you're coming down with something? You want me to get sick? (Offers Gail the sandwich) Bite?",JERRY,56,4
23,"I don't know. Once he leaves the building, he's out of my jurisdiction.",JERRY,56,4
24,"Alright. So, where ya cookin' now?",JERRY,56,4
25,"Ah, the power lunch crowd.",JERRY,56,4
26,Would you care to join us?,JERRY,56,4
27,See ya.,JERRY,56,4
28,That bothered you?,JERRY,56,4
29,It did?,JERRY,56,4
30,I thought your mother's paying for it.,JERRY,56,4
31,You what?,JERRY,56,4
32,You kissed her?,JERRY,56,4
33,What kinda great friend are you? How do you go from snubbing to kissing?,JERRY,56,4
34,And what did she do?,JERRY,56,4
35,"I don't get this. I go out with this girl three times, she doesn't want to shake my hand - why's she kissing you?",JERRY,56,4
36,So what?,JERRY,56,4
37,Are you alright?,JERRY,56,4
38,"Oh, Where did you eat?",JERRY,56,4
39,Ah. I know the chef there.,JERRY,56,4
40,"Oh, you have a daughter?",JERRY,56,4
41,What?,JERRY,56,4
42,What?,JERRY,56,4
43,I'm not sure. (The sounds of Russell vomiting emanate from the bathroom. Jerry and George sit there uncomfortably.) What was that dish he said he had...?,JERRY,56,4
44,"Ah. You know, 'primavera' is Italian for 'spring.'",JERRY,56,4
45,Yeah.,JERRY,56,4
46,Another ending?,JERRY,56,4
47,Maybe we should go.,JERRY,56,4
48,"I can't listen to anymore of this, the guy's losing a lung in there. (Russell's daughter Molly enters.)",JERRY,56,4
49,Hi.,JERRY,56,4
50,"Oh, I'm Jerry.",JERRY,56,4
51,We're here discussing our script with your father.,JERRY,56,4
52,Uh huh.,JERRY,56,4
53,What were you doing?,JERRY,56,4
54,You're supposed to just take a peek after a poke. You were like you just put a quarter into one of those big metal things on top of the Empire State Building.,JERRY,56,4
55,"Looking at cleavage is like looking at the sun, you don't stare at it. It's too risky. You get a sense of it and then you look away.",JERRY,56,4
56,That's why I poked.,JERRY,56,4
57,What?,JERRY,56,4
58,She did?,JERRY,56,4
59,Is that what she said? (Kramer pokes his head back in the door.),JERRY,56,4
60,She is?,JERRY,56,4
61,"Hello? Oh, hi Stu.",JERRY,56,4
62,"(to George) Yeah. (oh the phone) What's goin' on? What? Really? Oh my god....did he give you a reason?...Oh boy. Okay. Alright. Thanks. (hangs up.) Dalrymple just cancelled the pilot. (George drops the bag, shocked.)",JERRY,56,4
63,"There was cleavage in the area. That's a reflex - (mimics nudging someone with an elbow) - cleavage-poke, cleavage-poke...",JERRY,56,4
64,"You don't consider age in the face of cleavage. This occurs on a molecular level, you can't control it! We're like some kind of weird fish where the eyes operate independently of the head.",JERRY,56,4
65,"You know what we could do? He eats at that restaurant, Pfeiffer's? We could have Gail call us, tell us the next time he's there, go there and talk to him.",JERRY,56,4
66,The whole thing is so stupid. Like he wouldn't do the same thing if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.,JERRY,56,4
67,No.,JERRY,56,4
68,Ya.,JERRY,56,4
69,"Kramer, listen, I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor. The next time Russell Dalrymple comes in the restaurant, ask her if she would call me.",JERRY,56,4
70,Ok. (Kramer goes back to his apartment.),JERRY,56,4
71,"Look, sweetheart, you know you've got it all. But let's face it... (Kramer comes back.)",JERRY,56,4
72,Beautiful.,JERRY,56,4
73,"No, come on! I'll buy you another pair!",JERRY,56,4
74,I'll get you another one just like it!,JERRY,56,4
75,Hey! Whattaya know!,JERRY,56,4
76,Fancy meeting you here!,JERRY,56,4
77,"You know, it's a funny thing, because after the pilot got cancelled, we hadn't heard from you.",JERRY,56,4
78,Didn't know...we were wondering...what happened.,JERRY,56,4
79,No leer. (Elaine comes over to Russell's table.),JERRY,56,4
80,Really good.,JERRY,56,4
81,Very tasty.,JERRY,56,4
82,"The pilot's back on. In fact, Elaine's going out with him tomorrow night. (Gail nods and walks away.) Listen, Elaine, you know if Russell mentions anything about the pilot, you'll of course tell him how much you liked it...?",JERRY,56,4
83,"Uh...that kind of comedy, that's a little broad for us.",JERRY,56,4
84,It's funny!,JERRY,56,4
85,"Funny is funny, we're here to entertain, right?",JERRY,56,4
86,If you can.,JERRY,56,4
87,"I think what he's trying to say is, ""get the bouilla-base."" (George nods 'yes' and continues to choke.)",JERRY,56,4
0,"I mean, how funny is this?",GEORGE,56,4
1,"I mean, we're not stupid, right? We know when something's funny!",GEORGE,56,4
2,"Okay. Hey, you know what, maybe I should give it to my therapist to read. She's smart, I trust her.",GEORGE,56,4
3,"Hey, you know, we haven't brought the Elaine character into the show yet. Umm, We should try and get her into this scene.",GEORGE,56,4
4,Right,GEORGE,56,4
5,I don't even know what they think. That's why I'm in therapy.,GEORGE,56,4
6,"Alright, forget Elaine.",GEORGE,56,4
7,Hey.,GEORGE,56,4
8,"Yeah, I feel like I've grown.",GEORGE,56,4
9,"Great. (They both stand.) Oh, by the way, did you get a chance to read the script?",GEORGE,56,4
10,You didn't like it?,GEORGE,56,4
11,I can't believe this! What was wrong with it? What didn't you like about it?,GEORGE,56,4
12,"It wasn't funny? What, are you kidding?",GEORGE,56,4
13,You didn't find it funny?! This is what I'm paying for?,GEORGE,56,4
14,"Let me tell you who did, uh, buy it...um we pitched this story to Russell Dalrymple, the president of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.",GEORGE,56,4
15,"How's this for criticism? Um...you stink. How do like that criticism? You know what's funny to me? That diploma up on the wall. That is my idea of ""com-med-dee""! You sitting here, telling people what to do.",GEORGE,56,4
16,"Oh, I'm goin' baby. I'm goin.' (Heads for the door, then stops.) It's Jerry's fault. He took out all my good lines. He's such a control freak!",GEORGE,56,4
17,"Oh, she didn't think it was funny. What is she, Rowan & Martin? We're supposed to meet with NBC tomorrow! She completely shattered my confidence. And I'm paying for this, she's my employee!",GEORGE,56,4
18,"And she slaves to earn every penny. So that someday, I might be able to walk up to a woman and say, ""Yes, I'm bald, but I'm still a good person.""",GEORGE,56,4
19,"No they don't. I tried that once. I snubbed for a year. Nothing. Every woman I saw, I snubbed. You never saw people so pleased. (Elaine returns from the bathroom.)",GEORGE,56,4
20,JERRY & GEORGE: Hi.,GEORGE,56,4
21,My cousin worked for Bouchard's. They used to use the bouilla-base for a toilet. (Jerry and Russell are shocked.),GEORGE,56,4
22,"Well, you didn't hear it from me, but needless to say, if you go in there - stick with the consumee.",GEORGE,56,4
23,"Aw, that's a fun age. (Jerry looks at George distastefully.)",GEORGE,56,4
24,"Would you like a Pepto-Bismol? I keep them in my wallet...! (Russell goes into the bathroom and shuts the door.) (To Jerry) Do you think he liked it? (From the bathroom, we hear Russell violently heaving his guts.)",GEORGE,56,4
25,Pasta primavera.,GEORGE,56,4
26,No!,GEORGE,56,4
27,"So, you were saying how, um...about the script...",GEORGE,56,4
28,More jokes?,GEORGE,56,4
29,A different name for the butler? (Russell throws up again.),GEORGE,56,4
30,"We haven't heard his notes yet, we don't know how he feels about our work. (Russell throws up yet again.)",GEORGE,56,4
31,Hi.,GEORGE,56,4
32,George.,GEORGE,56,4
33,He just read it. (Russell vomits again. Jerry and George look ashamed.),GEORGE,56,4
34,"So, you live with your mother, huh?",GEORGE,56,4
35,"Of course, I'm the result of my parents having stayed together, so you never know. (Russell comes out of the bathroom.)",GEORGE,56,4
36,"You know, suddenly I'm in the mood for pasta primavera myself. (Jerry nudges George to sneak a peek at Molly's cleavage as she bends over and looks in her backpack. Jerry has a quick look, but George stares, hypnotized. Russell comes up behind George.)",GEORGE,56,4
37,"Well, it's not my fault. You poked me!",GEORGE,56,4
38,"It's cleavage. I couldn't look away. What am I, waiting to win an Oscar here? This is all I have in my life.",GEORGE,56,4
39,"All right. So, he caught me in a cleavage peek, so big deal. Who wouldn't look at his daughter's cleavage? She's got nice cleavage.",GEORGE,56,4
40,"That's why I peeked. (Jerry opens the door to take some trash out, and meets Kramer and Gail in the hallway.)",GEORGE,56,4
41,Pasta primavera?,GEORGE,56,4
42,He poked me!,GEORGE,56,4
43,"Alright, what's the difference. What are we gonna do now? He won't take our calls, we can't get into his office...",GEORGE,56,4
44,"Hey, now you're onto something.",GEORGE,56,4
45,"Yeah. Well, maybe not Elaine.",GEORGE,56,4
46,"But...somebody like Gail, though.",GEORGE,56,4
47,Beautiful.,GEORGE,56,4
48,Never mind!,GEORGE,56,4
49,Look who's here!,GEORGE,56,4
50,Didn't hear anything...,GEORGE,56,4
51,"Oh...uh, because if it had anything at all to do with what you perceived as me leering at your daughter, I really have to take issue with that. I did not leer. (To Jerry) Did I leer?",GEORGE,56,4
52,"Because, if I'm looking straight ahead, and something enters my field of vision, that's merely a happenstance. (Elaine loudly snaps and unfolds her napkin at the next table to get Russell's attention.)",GEORGE,56,4
53,This pasta primavera is fabulous.,GEORGE,56,4
54,Great.,GEORGE,56,4
55,"Well, it's a funny idea.",GEORGE,56,4
56,"C'mon, funny is funny.",GEORGE,56,4
57,"Yeah. Where's he taking you, by the way?",GEORGE,56,4
0,"Well, I thought there was going to be a character named Elaine Benes.",ELAINE,56,4
1,"You couldn't ""keep track"" of everybody?",ELAINE,56,4
2,You have no idea?,ELAINE,56,4
3,"Hi, Gail.",ELAINE,56,4
4,I thought you were finished.,ELAINE,56,4
5,Oh. Thank you.,ELAINE,56,4
6,Really.,ELAINE,56,4
7,"Yes, it bothered me. So I bought a pair of shoes at Botticelli's, I'm not allowed to shop there? That really embarrassed me.",ELAINE,56,4
8,Yes! Couldn't you see that?,ELAINE,56,4
9,I guess she didn't think it was funny.,ELAINE,56,4
10,What did I think of it? (Manufactures a cough instead of answering. Kramer enters.),ELAINE,56,4
11,"Well, you know, I...",ELAINE,56,4
12,What? Who told you that?,ELAINE,56,4
13,"I don't understand, why is this woman talking about my shoes? Why are my shoes a topic of conversation?",ELAINE,56,4
14,"So what?! She is talking about my shoes! She is discussing my shoes! It is nobody's business where I buy my shoes! (Storms over to the couch and angrily sits down. Jerry, Kramer and George look at Elaine from the kitchen, comically puzzled by her outburst...)",ELAINE,56,4
15,Hey! Gail!,ELAINE,56,4
16,Why are you talking about my shoes?,ELAINE,56,4
17,My Botticelli shoes. You've been talking about my Botticelli shoes.,ELAINE,56,4
18,Did you or did you not tell Kramer that I got my shoes at Botticelli's? (A waiter comes over and puts a plate of food on Gail's cutting board.),ELAINE,56,4
19,"Who else have you mentioned my shoes to, huh? I wanna know why my footwear is your conversation!",ELAINE,56,4
20,"Look, I don't like people talking about my shoes behind my back, okay? My shoes are my business. The two of you shouldn't have been looking at some fifteen year-old's cleavage anyway!",ELAINE,56,4
21,But she was fifteen.,ELAINE,56,4
22,"What? What do you mean, Gail? (Kramer enters.)",ELAINE,56,4
23,What?,ELAINE,56,4
24,She wants my shoes? What kind of person is this? Alright! She is not getting 'em!,ELAINE,56,4
25,"No, these were the last pair of these that they had!",ELAINE,56,4
26,"No, but these were the only really cool ones like this! Don't you see how everybody likes 'em and how everybody talks about 'em? (Jerry, realizing Elaine's motivation, sits at the counter unbelievingly.)",ELAINE,56,4
27,"Oh yeah, because she caught you jer -",ELAINE,56,4
28,"Oh, come on, wait a second, this whole thing is ridiculous. How do I even know she wears the same size?",ELAINE,56,4
29,Seven-and-a-half.,ELAINE,56,4
30,"Here's your ketchup back. You know, I had the hardest time trying to get some out. I mean, I just kept pounding and pounding on the bottom of it. Do you have any trouble?",ELAINE,56,4
31,Mmmm.,ELAINE,56,4
32,"You know, I happen to have the script right here with me and, uh...on page 3, for example, suppose the Elaine character comes in wearing a...a low-cut dress. And the butler is very distracted, and can't work.",ELAINE,56,4
33,"Well, I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.",ELAINE,56,4
34,"Alright, well, maybe I'll mention it to Russell tomorrow night.",ELAINE,56,4
35,"Bouchard's, on 53rd. (George starts choking on his wine, and attempts to tell Elaine something.)",ELAINE,56,4
0,Hey.,KRAMER,56,4
1,Your old flame. Gail Cunningham.,KRAMER,56,4
2,"Well, I was on my way to the Y, and I saw her coming towards me? I didn't know what to do! Because I remembered you had three dates with her and she wouldn't kiss you goodnight. So now I'm thinking you know, what is my duty to my friend? Do I acknowledge her? Do I you know ignore her? I mean, what is my responsibility here?",KRAMER,56,4
3,"Yeah, yeah, so she sees me and she goes, (imitates Gail) ""Oh, hi! Kramer!"" You know? Like nothing happened! Like she never you know went three dates with you and refused to kiss you goodnight.",KRAMER,56,4
4,You know what I did? I snubbed her.,KRAMER,56,4
5,I walked right by her - bffffft - never said a word.,KRAMER,56,4

7,"Yeah. Well, you know, she was lucky I was in a good mood - coulda been a lot worse.",KRAMER,56,4
8,"I just kissed Gail Cunningham. (Jerry turns and looks at Kramer, shocked. Elaine grins and heads to the bathroom.)",KRAMER,56,4
9,"Yeah, I kissed her.",KRAMER,56,4
10,Right on the mouth.,KRAMER,56,4
11,"Well, I saw her outside the Y, you know, she came up to me, she started yelling because I snubbed her, and then we started talking a little bit, and I walked her to her building. And just before I left, I put my arm around her waist, I pulled her to me, and I - mmm - I planted one! (Laughs.)",KRAMER,56,4
12,She kissed me back.,KRAMER,56,4
13,Gail Cunningham.,KRAMER,56,4
14,"Well, you know, we were just talking, and uh she mentioned how you're buying your shoes now at Botticelli's.",KRAMER,56,4
15,Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.,KRAMER,56,4
16,"She's sensual. You know, with the...cooking and all. (Kramer grins happily at Jerry and leaves. The phone rings. Jerry tosses the trashbag to George.)",KRAMER,56,4

So it's conceivable that while she's getting the lingerie, he'd be at a nude bar watching a table dancer wearing the same outfit. That is possible. But to me, the difference between being single and being married, is the form of government. You see, when you're single, you are the dictator of your own life. I have complete power. I can give the order to fall asleep on the sofa with the TV on in the middle of the day, no-one can overrule me! When you're married, you're part of a vast decision-making body. Before anything gets done there are meetings. Committees have to study the situation. And this is if the marriage works. That's what's so painful about divorce: you get impeached and you're not even the president!",JERRY,62,4

14,(to Kramer) Who is it?,JERRY,63,4
15,NBC!?! Give me the phone!,JERRY,63,4
16,Get off the phone!,JERRY,63,4
17,You know I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?,JERRY,63,4
18,"All right. Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot.

19,Where?,JERRY,63,4
20,"Get out of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The Heart Attack')",JERRY,63,4
21,Would you stop?,JERRY,63,4
22,"If you go, maybe they'll catch it in time.",JERRY,63,4
23,Whatever it is.,JERRY,63,4
24,(to George) You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola.,JERRY,63,4
25,"Yeah, where is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.",JERRY,63,4
26,(thinking) They've gotta be kidding.,JERRY,63,4
27,Everything all right?,JERRY,63,4
28,No you didn't. He knows he's bald.,JERRY,63,4
29,"(getting up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.",JERRY,63,4
30,"Alright, want to start?",JERRY,63,4
31,O.K.,JERRY,63,4
32,What look?,JERRY,63,4
33,I gave a look?,JERRY,63,4
34,(smiling and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.,JERRY,63,4
35,Very good,JERRY,63,4
36,(to George) It was a wonderful reading.,JERRY,63,4
37,"Yeah, I liked him.",JERRY,63,4

39,"Oh, don't worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.",JERRY,63,4
40,Yes.,JERRY,63,4
41,"She's an eskimo, actually.",JERRY,63,4
42,"She came down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.",JERRY,63,4
43,"No, he didn't show up.",JERRY,63,4
44,No. No you're not.,JERRY,63,4
45,I don't know.,JERRY,63,4
46,Yeah. Have you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?,JERRY,63,4
47,Beside that. Look at the waitresses.,JERRY,63,4
48,What physical characteristic would you say is common to all of them?,JERRY,63,4
49,I mean look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions. Wouldn't you say?,JERRY,63,4
50,What's going on here. How is that possible?,JERRY,63,4
51,No. I haven't seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.,JERRY,63,4
52,Hey that's life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome homeless.,JERRY,63,4
53,What did he say?,JERRY,63,4
54,Alright. So?,JERRY,63,4
55,"Well, maybe he doesn't have a ""get outta here"" kind of personality.",JERRY,63,4
56,Can't you at least die with a little dignity?,JERRY,63,4
57,Hey. What happened to you yesterday?,JERRY,63,4
58,Mugged?,JERRY,63,4
59,Why didn't you use the bathroom in the building?,JERRY,63,4
60,Yeah?,JERRY,63,4
61,Come on up.,JERRY,63,4
62,What is it?,JERRY,63,4
63,You didn't go?,JERRY,63,4
64,The % thing to do is just not think about it.,JERRY,63,4
65,He's a little backed up.,JERRY,63,4
66,"Oh, the sisters (he sits at the table)",JERRY,63,4
67,This is what you gonna wear?,JERRY,63,4
68,You're not gonna get the job.,JERRY,63,4
69,"(to the phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)",JERRY,63,4

71,They're having sex in the hotel room.,JERRY,63,4
72,Yes.,JERRY,63,4
73,"Uh, Huh, yeah.",JERRY,63,4
74,"Well, she's fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window, yet she's extremely dainty.",JERRY,63,4
75,With her hands.,JERRY,63,4
76,Also with her hands.,JERRY,63,4

79,Shaft.,JERRY,63,4
80,She likes talking during sex.,JERRY,63,4
81,"No. Just chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking at his watch)",JERRY,63,4
82,What?,JERRY,63,4
83,All right. Elaine.,JERRY,63,4
84,Well--,JERRY,63,4
85,"Actually she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--",JERRY,63,4
86,I think you got it.,JERRY,63,4
0,Why are two pretending to be laughing?,GEORGE,63,4
1,"Oh, real good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?",GEORGE,63,4
2,I don't understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong. Maybe they're not doing it.,GEORGE,63,4
3,Out of the question.,GEORGE,63,4
4,(to Jerry) How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing? (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know),GEORGE,63,4
5,He's getting phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips out of a big bag),GEORGE,63,4
6,What? I'm comfortable.,GEORGE,63,4
7,What if the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?,GEORGE,63,4
8,"Yeah, that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful. He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.",GEORGE,63,4
9,I do for the bad things.,GEORGE,63,4
10,What?,GEORGE,63,4
11,"(gets up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.",GEORGE,63,4
12,Better get that checked out?,GEORGE,63,4
13,"What kind of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?",GEORGE,63,4
14,"What are you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)",GEORGE,63,4
15,Oh I'm going baby! I'm going! (he leaves),GEORGE,63,4
16,Right here. (showing his lip),GEORGE,63,4
17,"(to the cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?",GEORGE,63,4
18,"Oh, my God.",GEORGE,63,4
19,(to Jerry) It's all white Jerry! It's all white!,GEORGE,63,4
20,"Again with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.",GEORGE,63,4
21,Catch what in time?,GEORGE,63,4
22,You think it's something?,GEORGE,63,4
23,(to Jay) What do you think it is?,GEORGE,63,4
24,Yeah. So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna be on TV the following week?,GEORGE,63,4
25,(thinking) This guy's perfect.,GEORGE,63,4
26,"No, not a loser!",GEORGE,63,4
27,Thank you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George),GEORGE,63,4
28,Very nice,GEORGE,63,4
29,"Very nice Tom, that was terrific.",GEORGE,63,4
30,Sure. Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins),GEORGE,63,4
31,Yeah. Really.,GEORGE,63,4
32,Take care. Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director),GEORGE,63,4
33,What happened to the raisins?,GEORGE,63,4
34,Did he just steal the raisins?,GEORGE,63,4
35,"You see, It's right here. It's all white...",GEORGE,63,4
36,You've never seen this before?,GEORGE,63,4
37,(dramatically) A what?,GEORGE,63,4
38,A biopsy?,GEORGE,63,4
39,Cancer? Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?,GEORGE,63,4
40,A biopsy!,GEORGE,63,4
41,He said he didn't know what it was.,GEORGE,63,4
42,"When I asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a ""get outta here"". That's what I wanted to hear: ""Cancer? Get outta here?""",GEORGE,63,4
43,"How could you be a doctor and not say ""get outta here""? It should be part of the training at medical school: ""Cancer? Get outta here!"" ""Go home! What are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut. You know that?"" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this. (showing his lip)",GEORGE,63,4
44,No I can't. I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should I die with dignity?,GEORGE,63,4
45,You got mugged?,GEORGE,63,4
46,Elaine.,GEORGE,63,4
47,(to Jerry) Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee in my life.,GEORGE,63,4
48,Apply for a job? What for?,GEORGE,63,4
49,It's a coincidence.,GEORGE,63,4
0,"Oh, that's O.K. I don't have much time though. So...",ELAINE,63,4
1,That was two months ago.,ELAINE,63,4
2,"Russell, you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks up the bowl of munchies on the table)",ELAINE,63,4
3,"God I hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table. Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things (she does).",ELAINE,63,4
4,"Um... Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life. I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something, that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on, Russell, you're part of the problem.",ELAINE,63,4
5,"Oh yeah, oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that ""Did you ever notice this? Did you ever notice that?"" guy.",ELAINE,63,4
6,Really? What is it about?,ELAINE,63,4
7,(surprised) What do you mean it's about nothing?,ELAINE,63,4
8,"Um, I got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.",ELAINE,63,4
9,"Russell, see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to work (she gets up). So...",ELAINE,63,4
10,"I'm sorry Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her leaving).",ELAINE,63,4
11,So who's playing Elaine?,ELAINE,63,4
12,Really?,ELAINE,63,4
13,Who is it?,ELAINE,63,4
14,"Oh, my God (not in the mood to be kidding)",ELAINE,63,4
15,"Listen, was Russell at the casting?",ELAINE,63,4
16,"You know, I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?",ELAINE,63,4
17,Why do I keep setting you up?,ELAINE,63,4
18,"(to the waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service here is *really* slow.",ELAINE,63,4
19,Mmm. They're putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.,ELAINE,63,4
20,Yeah? (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts),ELAINE,63,4
21,Ah...,ELAINE,63,4
22,"Yes, I would say.",ELAINE,63,4
23,Do you think it's a coincidence?,ELAINE,63,4
24,(to the waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?,ELAINE,63,4
25,"You know what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?",ELAINE,63,4
26,It's me.,ELAINE,63,4
27,Hey.,ELAINE,63,4
28,What's the matter with him?,ELAINE,63,4
29,Oh...,ELAINE,63,4
30,So I spoke to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.,ELAINE,63,4
31,So we decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.,ELAINE,63,4
32,"Because, it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirts, untucked)",ELAINE,63,4
33,Yeah.,ELAINE,63,4
34,Exactly.,ELAINE,63,4
35,Who was it?,ELAINE,63,4
36,What about the dogs?,ELAINE,63,4
37,"No, I'd like to apply for a waitress job.",ELAINE,63,4
38,"Oh yeah. I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find that I'm more than qualified.",ELAINE,63,4
39,You're in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves),ELAINE,63,4
40,"Anyway there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.",ELAINE,63,4
41,"Oh, he's this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to say.",ELAINE,63,4
42,"Um... Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses, and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and he rejected me.",ELAINE,63,4
43,Hi.,ELAINE,63,4
0,Why can't I play Kramer?,KRAMER,63,4

10,Oughh!,KRAMER,63,4
11,"(to the phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)",KRAMER,63,4
12,That's NBC.,KRAMER,63,4
13,I'm in the middle of a conversation here.,KRAMER,63,4
14,"(to the phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)",KRAMER,63,4
15,Russell Dalrimple's secretary.,KRAMER,63,4
16,That's true.,KRAMER,63,4

18,Yeah. Be right back. (Kramer leaves),KRAMER,63,4
19,I got mugged.,KRAMER,63,4
20,"Well, I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the bathroom.",KRAMER,63,4
21,"It was full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me and...",KRAMER,63,4
22,"But now I have a big problem, buddy.",KRAMER,63,4
23,"Well, I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.",KRAMER,63,4
24,No. And now I can't get it back.,KRAMER,63,4
25,How could you not think about it?,KRAMER,63,4
26,(mumbles and leaves),KRAMER,63,4
27,"I like to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long, and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order) Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.",KRAMER,63,4
28,"Yeah, that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.",KRAMER,63,4
29,You gotta play him like me. I'm Kramer.,KRAMER,63,4
30,"Whoa, I'm Kramer.",KRAMER,63,4
0,It's made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.,JERRY,64,4
1,No I'm not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?,JERRY,64,4
2,Danish. Is it from Denmark?,JERRY,64,4
3,"George? (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff. But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told how to say the lines.",JERRY,64,4
4,"I don't know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?",JERRY,64,4
5,Why would he steal a box of raisins?,JERRY,64,4
6,Nothing.,JERRY,64,4
7,No.,JERRY,64,4
8,Are we going out?,JERRY,64,4
9,Do you want me to break up with you?,JERRY,64,4
10,I don't even know what you're talking about.,JERRY,64,4
11,All right. We're broken up.,JERRY,64,4
12,Ah! You're fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.,JERRY,64,4
13,Because I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!,JERRY,64,4
14,This show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved in this.,JERRY,64,4
15,"This actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.",JERRY,64,4
16,Why?,JERRY,64,4
17,You mentioned the raisins.,JERRY,64,4
18,Did he take 'em?,JERRY,64,4
19,"Well if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?",JERRY,64,4
20,Hey.,JERRY,64,4
21,Any luck?,JERRY,64,4

35,"Hey, what about Russell? Did you hear from him?",JERRY,64,4

51,Hey. The butler's here.,JERRY,64,4
52,I'm not sending him to your house.,JERRY,64,4

1,"Uh, excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to the guy's in charge of yelling: ""take #!"") This--This is not right. May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: ""They fooled *me* Jerry!"" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled' more: ""They *fooled* me Jerry!"". You see the difference?",GEORGE,64,4
2,Just a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy),GEORGE,64,4
3,(very casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!,GEORGE,64,4
4,Why is that?,GEORGE,64,4
5,"Oh, you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?",GEORGE,64,4
6,"Yeah, it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)",GEORGE,64,4
7,Remember when you came to audition for us?,GEORGE,64,4
8,"There was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance, take them with you when left?",GEORGE,64,4

I say, let's let bygones be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins-- They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins. We'll have a nice laugh.",GEORGE,64,4

85,You're a baby!,JERRY,65,5
86,They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?,JERRY,65,5
87,You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.,JERRY,65,5
88,Hey.,JERRY,65,5
89,Why can't you get it?,JERRY,65,5

96,Yeah.,JERRY,65,5
97,Hello Elaine? Patty Lawrence had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?,JERRY,65,5
98,Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?,JERRY,65,5
99,All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?,JERRY,65,5
100,Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.,JERRY,65,5
101,How soft?,JERRY,65,5

114,I'm banned?!,JERRY,65,5
115,Put it over there.,JERRY,65,5
116,What are you doing?,JERRY,65,5
117,You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.,JERRY,65,5
118,"Sorry, I don't have any cash.",JERRY,65,5
119,What?,JERRY,65,5
120,What is it?,JERRY,65,5

128,"Yeah, see you.",JERRY,65,5
129,(shocked) What?,JERRY,65,5
130,Are you serious?,JERRY,65,5
131,"Sex... to save the friendship. (Elaine drops her bag, takes off her jacket and walks into Jerry's bedroom) Well, if we have to (un-tucks his shirt) we have to.",JERRY,65,5
132,It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. It got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!,JERRY,65,5
0,Karen.,GEORGE,65,5

13,Yeah.,GEORGE,65,5
14,I-I don't know. Last time I got the tap.,GEORGE,65,5
15,"You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.",GEORGE,65,5
16,It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.,GEORGE,65,5
17,"No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.",GEORGE,65,5
18,You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.,GEORGE,65,5
19,"Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.",GEORGE,65,5
20,Nothing.,GEORGE,65,5
21,Nobody's faking.,GEORGE,65,5

26,We got a chocolate malt in here!,GEORGE,65,5
27,I'm sure you are.,GEORGE,65,5
28,Maybe Karen is faking.,GEORGE,65,5
29,"(thinking of the moans) Heh. (Karen takes another puff of her cigarette) You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. (chuckles) You have a very contented air over there. (chuckles again) You look very contented, very satisfied. (pauses) Are you satisfied?",GEORGE,65,5
30,I-I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?,GEORGE,65,5
31,"Hey listen... umm, instead of the movie... uh, maybe we'll go back and uh you know...(nudges her head with his head)",GEORGE,65,5
32,So... uh you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... you're generally okay with everything in there?,GEORGE,65,5
33,Do you uh feel the way you feel after the Risotto?,GEORGE,65,5
34,Yeah...(scratching his head) full.,GEORGE,65,5
35,It's Jerry's fault.,GEORGE,65,5
36,Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.,GEORGE,65,5
37,So you feel okay?,GEORGE,65,5
38,"It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'",GEORGE,65,5
39,I hate him!,GEORGE,65,5
40,It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.,GEORGE,65,5
41,"Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?",GEORGE,65,5
42,"Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?",GEORGE,65,5
43,"All right, where do you want it?",GEORGE,65,5
44,All right I gotta get going.,GEORGE,65,5
45,I got a date with Karen. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.,GEORGE,65,5
46,I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.,GEORGE,65,5
47,"That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.",GEORGE,65,5
48,You see... All right I knew it.,GEORGE,65,5
49,I don't want any mango.,GEORGE,65,5
50,Very good. Juicy.,GEORGE,65,5
51,"Ripe. Boy, this Joe's got some terrific fruit.",GEORGE,65,5
52,I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!,GEORGE,65,5
53,"I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.",GEORGE,65,5
54,"I'm back, baby, I'm back!",GEORGE,65,5
55,"Please, it's not necessary.",GEORGE,65,5
56,"The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?",GEORGE,65,5
57,What am I talking about? Come on. (laughing) You don't think I bought all that? (does a little move),GEORGE,65,5
58,You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. Y-You really had me going there for a minute.,GEORGE,65,5
59,"Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.",GEORGE,65,5
60,What?,GEORGE,65,5
61,But why?,GEORGE,65,5
62,I-I-I can't find my glasses.,GEORGE,65,5
63,I need to look for my glasses.,GEORGE,65,5

30,"Mmm, hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?",ELAINE,65,5
31,You don't like her?,ELAINE,65,5
32,"I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.",ELAINE,65,5
33,"I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.",ELAINE,65,5
34,What's the matter?,ELAINE,65,5
35,You're not still thinking about that are you?,ELAINE,65,5

60,"Uh-huh, yeah. (Smiling, nodding, clearly wanting Bryant to shut up)",JERRY,66,5
61,"(Losing it, mad) Look, it's not my shirt.",JERRY,66,5

66,Yeah.,JERRY,66,5
67,"(Pointing out) It didn't do me any good either! That benefit was the worst show I ever did. Some of those heckles were really uncalled for: ""Avast ye matey"" - what the hell does that mean?!

25,"Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom. His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod and I picked it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.",GEORGE,68,5
26,"Well, they're more than an underwear to me Mr. Farkus. Two cups in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?",GEORGE,68,5

30,"Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation point?",ELAINE,68,5
31,"See, right here you wrote ""Myra had the baby"", but you didn't use an exclamation point.",ELAINE,68,5
32,"So, it's ya nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it curious.",ELAINE,68,5
33,"Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.",ELAINE,68,5
34,You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an exclamation point.,ELAINE,68,5
35,I just thought you would be a little more excited about a friend of mine having a baby.,ELAINE,68,5
36,"Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!",ELAINE,68,5
37,Why?,ELAINE,68,5
38,"Well, I felt a call for one.",ELAINE,68,5

45,"Look it, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof. This is all speculation and hearsay.",ELAINE,68,5

50,"Right, well...",ELAINE,68,5
51,"That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't like to be ch-ch-chilly...",ELAINE,68,5
52,"Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then (prrt) nothing comes out...",ELAINE,68,5
53,"Ok, ok ok ...",ELAINE,68,5
54,...ok I'll just....,ELAINE,68,5

6,"And Newman gave you money too. So, I didn't even meet this guy. You know, we trusted you.",KRAMER,68,5
7,"Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang? Did he use the word 'man'?",KRAMER,68,5
8,"I mean when he was leaving did he say ""I'm splittin'""?",KRAMER,68,5
9,Whoh!,KRAMER,68,5

19,What's today?,KRAMER,68,5
20,Really? Feels like Tuesday.,KRAMER,68,5
21,I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...,KRAMER,68,5

40,Double exclamation point!,KRAMER,68,5
41,"Hey, Ralph.",KRAMER,68,5
42,"Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?",KRAMER,68,5
43,What's the matter? You've got a cold?,KRAMER,68,5

20,A Mohel is the person that performs the circumcision.,JERRY,69,5
21,"Oh, finding a Mohel is a piece of cake. Any idiot can find a Mohel. I have to hold the baby while they do it. That's a tough job. How would you like that?",JERRY,69,5

29,What now?,JERRY,69,5
30,"(Kramer shows Jerry and Elaine the paper) ""Hospital receives grant to conduct DNA research"".."" Government funds genetic research at area hospital"" ... Yeah, so?",JERRY,69,5
31,"Oh, will you stop it. Just because a hospital studying DNA research doesn't mean they're creating a race of mutant pig-men!",JERRY,69,5
32,"Believe me, there'd be plenty of women going for these pig-men. Whatever the deformity is there's always some group of perverts that's attracted to it. ""Oo that little tail really turns me on.""",JERRY,69,5
33,"Oh, what's the matter this doesn't interest you?",JERRY,69,5
34,"(TO GEORGE) Hey George, you ever see one?",JERRY,69,5
35,So what'd you think?,JERRY,69,5
36,"Alright, I'm waiting. I-I want to see the pig-man. Show me the pig- man.",JERRY,69,5
37,"Maybe he's just a guy with a nose like this. (holds his nose up like a pig) You know a lot of people have a nose like this, they're not necessarily pig-men.",JERRY,69,5
38,"Well, if I hear an anguished ""oink"", I'm outta here. I-I don't see any pig-men. Look (HE POINTS AT PASSERBY) Human, human, human... (HE LOOKS DOWN CORRIDOR, WITH ALARM.) (WITH MOCK ALARM) Wait a second! (Grabs Kramer)",JERRY,69,5

42,Where's the Mohel?,JERRY,69,5
43,He's late already.,JERRY,69,5
44,"I don't know why he asked me to be the Godfather. We're not even that close of friends. Just cause we're on the softball team, I'm the pitcher, he's the catcher he thinks we have a special relationship?",JERRY,69,5
45,Well maybe in hardball with all the signals and everything but I'm just lobbing it in. We don't have any conferences. He doesn't come out to the mound and encourage me.,JERRY,69,5
46,Don't they have any closer friends. They're level jumping on our friendship.,JERRY,69,5
47,Hello.,JERRY,69,5
48,(uncertain) Yeah. I'm holding the baby.,JERRY,69,5

53,That damn Mohel - he circumcised my finger! The Mohel circumcised my finger!,JERRY,69,5
54,"Flinched? I did not flinch. George, did I flinch?",JERRY,69,5
55,Who's got a tissues? I need more tissues! Look at this thing. It's my phone finger!,JERRY,69,5
56,Oh the baby's fine. They just took him to the hospital as a precautionary measure. But look at me. I'm the one who's hurt.,JERRY,69,5
57,A few stitches? I've never had stitches. I'll be deformed. I can't live with that. It goes against my whole personality. It's not me!,JERRY,69,5
58,That was a one in a million Mohel.,JERRY,69,5
59,Look at this.,JERRY,69,5
60,Oh well if it isn't Shakey the Mohel! Nice job on the circumcision but it's not supposed to be a finger.,JERRY,69,5
61,"Oh who made you a Mohel? Whadya, get your degree from a matchbook?",JERRY,69,5
62,"Nice Mohel picking, Elaine. You picked a helluva Mohel!",JERRY,69,5
63,"Oh don't threaten me, Butcher Boy.",JERRY,69,5
64,Ya what was this? (HE IMITATES MOHEL'S FLINCHING),JERRY,69,5
65,It was not!,JERRY,69,5
66,"(struggling to open a bottle with his bandaged finger) I can't do it. (A LA GODFATHER) Look what they did to my boy, They massacred my boy.",JERRY,69,5
67,"(walking over the the buzzer to answer it) Oh, that's the Flicks.",JERRY,69,5
68,"Myra, Stan.",JERRY,69,5
69,What's the matter?,JERRY,69,5
0,What about that spot I got?,GEORGE,69,5
1,"You open the door to the car, boom, you walk right into the hospital. Eh, You can't beat that spot. (starts doing a little dance) I am on a roll. I'm just willing these great parking spots.",GEORGE,69,5
2,"Maybe the baby would like to see my spot. A positive, uplifting message to start his life out with. Huh, You can still get a great space in this city - if you apply yourself.",GEORGE,69,5
3,You gotta look at this. I pulled it in perfectly equidistant from the car in front of me and the car behind me.,GEORGE,69,5
4,"Kramer, what the hell are you talking about?",GEORGE,69,5
5,A pig-man?,GEORGE,69,5
6,"(knocks on the window) Hey, why are all those people milling around my car?",GEORGE,69,5
7,"Hey, there's a guy up the roof.",GEORGE,69,5
8,"Oh well, I hope he doesn't jum...",GEORGE,69,5
9,My car! My caaaaarrrr!,GEORGE,69,5
10,"Well I just got the estimate. It's going to cost more to fix that roof than the car's worth, So I'm going over to see that hospital administrator today. Someone is gonna pay for this damage and it's not gonna be me.",GEORGE,69,5
11,"I know, swan dives from twenty floors up, lands right on top. What do I got a bulls eye up there? He couldn't move over two feet? Land on the sidewalk. It's city property.",GEORGE,69,5
12,"I tell you something. I wish there were pig-men. You get a few of these pig-men walking around suddenly I'm looking a whole lot better. Then if somebody wants to fix me up at least they could say, ""Hey he's no pig-man!""",GEORGE,69,5
13,"But Kramer, isn't it a question of hygiene?",GEORGE,69,5
14,Yeah. So how does that help me?,GEORGE,69,5
15,"Yeah, my roommate in college.",GEORGE,69,5
16,(thinks for a second) I got used to it.,GEORGE,69,5
17,Alright the administrator's on the third floor. I'll meet you guys back at the car.,GEORGE,69,5
18,The pig-man can take the bus.,GEORGE,69,5
19,How do you know? What if pig-man had a two-seater?,GEORGE,69,5
20,"I'll tell you what, if pig-man shows up, we'll squeeze him in. I'll see you later.",GEORGE,69,5
21,"Well, I join them in their grief.",GEORGE,69,5
22,"That's where I come in. Umm, on splat. Uh, you see, Mrs. Sweedler, or is it hospital administrator Sweedler?",GEORGE,69,5
23,"Mrs. Sweedler thank you. Y-You see, this tragedy affected me in a very, very personal way.",GEORGE,69,5
24,"Yes, well you see, the deceased landed on my car. The uh splat, as it were, actually occurred on the roof of my car. Now of course I can't help but feel that had it been a convertible this whole tragedy might have been averted but I've never been the kind of guy to buy a convertible, what with the baldness and everything.",GEORGE,69,5
25,"Yes but then everything is all pulled down and it's jus.. Anyway. The damage, unfortunately, has marred an otherwise fine automobile, rendering it virtually undriveable.",GEORGE,69,5
26,"Yes, a shame. That is exactly how I would put it. Now Mrs. Sweedler, with all due discretion and sensitivity, and taking in the whole scope of the situation, I just can't help but think that, the hospital is somehow responsible for compensating the other, still living 'victim' of horrendous, horrendous tragedy.",GEORGE,69,5
27,Yes.,GEORGE,69,5
28,Yes.,GEORGE,69,5
29,"(PULLING OUT ESTIMATE OUT OF HIS POCKET) Well, profit. I think you'll see from the estimate that I'm not really profiting that much. They might be a little high, but..",GEORGE,69,5
30,Should I leave this..?,GEORGE,69,5
31,So uh... been to a bris before?,GEORGE,69,5
32,"I've been to a few of em. If you uh start to get woozy later, which is quite common, stay close to me. I'll get you through it. (chuckles)",GEORGE,69,5
33,Oh.,GEORGE,69,5
34,"(getting up out of his chair to get out of the Mohel's way) No, No.",GEORGE,69,5
35,"Alright, alright!",GEORGE,69,5
36,"It was very traumatic. The last thing I remember is you flinching. Then, everything went black.",GEORGE,69,5
37,"Be careful, you're getting blood all over the car.",GEORGE,69,5
38,"Hey look a that - boy are you lucky - another great spot - right in front of the hospital. In an emergency yet! How lucky are you huh? Is that unbelievable? How unbelievable is that huh? Come on, give it to me, give it to me.",GEORGE,69,5
39,I have never seen a Mohel like that.,GEORGE,69,5
40,"Wha, where is he going?",GEORGE,69,5
41,"(ON PHONE) It's a '76 Chevy Impala. They stole it right in front of the hospital. I saw the guy drive off in it. Well he's about five feet tall, hairless, pink complexion.. (Elaine puts her finger on her nose) looks like a pig. Yeah, alright alright, thank you, thank you. (Kramer enters) So any word from the ""pig-man""?",GEORGE,69,5
42,No. And he's not a pig-man is he?,GEORGE,69,5
0,Whoa.,ELAINE,69,5
1,First the sucking then the weaning.,ELAINE,69,5
2,Must wean.,ELAINE,69,5

19,"Oh, no, it's fascinating, but could you do me a favor, could ya tape the rest of the pig-men and the women who love them discussion and I'll listen to it the next time I'm here. I've gotta go find a Mohel.",ELAINE,69,5
20,"Well, perhaps one day when the pig-men roam free it will be stopped Kramer. Until then, off with their heads.",ELAINE,69,5
21,He'll be here.,ELAINE,69,5

And that goofy scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. ""That'll be 30, love...

42,"Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door) where would we be going?",GEORGE,70,5

45,What are they saying now?,GEORGE,70,5

16,"Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. Alright it's terrible, but I'm not a terrible person.",ELAINE,70,5
17,"No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say ""get out of here"". I never ever throw things at them and try to injure them like other people.",ELAINE,70,5

25,Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.,ELAINE,70,5
26,So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.,ELAINE,70,5
27,I beg to differ.,ELAINE,70,5

46,He tells him which soap to use.,ELAINE,71,5
47,"Well, as far as I know, he bumped his arm into a door and it's kind of got this in(pauses)voluntarily movement. Some sort of a (clears her throat) spasm. So, anyway, you're a..you're a big advisor to Dinkins, huh?",ELAINE,71,5
48,Wow! You know what I would do if I was running for mayor. One of my campaign themes would be that everybody should wear name tags all the time to make the city friendlier.,ELAINE,71,5

61,"Hey, you guys, listen to this. Listen to this. (reading from the newspaper) Apparently some blood spilled into Mr. Giuliani's test tube causing his cholesterol count to be 150 points higher than was initially reported.

45,"No, I don't know. Maybe you haven't. You know, not everybody's seen a massage table.",GEORGE,73,5
46,"Anyway, I don't even get a thank you. I don't get it!",GEORGE,73,5
47,I wanna know what I did to this woman.,GEORGE,73,5
48,"No, No! She's going out with a friend of mine. It's only courteous that we should try and like each other.",GEORGE,73,5
49,Yes! Yes! Everybody has to like me. I must be liked!,GEORGE,73,5
50,"You know what? I should really go talk to her. Nothing confrontational. Just two adults sitting down trying to clear the air. You know, I just know if I could spend some time alone with her. I've got to. (he grabs his jacket) I've got to.",GEORGE,73,5
51,I think I can still catch her.,GEORGE,73,5
52,What? What are you talking about.,GEORGE,73,5
53,I know. I know.,GEORGE,73,5
54,"(he thinks a little about it... and as he puts his hand on his knee and gets up) I'm sorry Karen. I know I care for you, but I just can't stand when someone doesn't like me. (he opens the door)",GEORGE,73,5
55,That I'm used to. (he leaves),GEORGE,73,5
56,"Jerry, could you excuse us for a few minutes, please?",GEORGE,73,5
57,We need to talk.,GEORGE,73,5
58,Look it's no secret what's going on between us. (to Jerry) She doesn't like me. Now Jerry if you don't mind.,GEORGE,73,5
59,(he makes a sign to Jodi to wait and turns to Jerry) Jerry... This woman hates me so much. I'm starting to like her.,GEORGE,73,5
60,She just dislikes me so much... It's irresistable.,GEORGE,73,5
61,A woman that hates me this much comes along once in a lifetime.,GEORGE,73,5
62,I got to go after her.,GEORGE,73,5
63,JODI! (he starts running after her),GEORGE,73,5
0,It isn't?,ELAINE,73,5
1,Get out!,ELAINE,73,5
2,You remember the date?,ELAINE,73,5
3,"Boy, you know when Joel told me he hadn't thrown up in eight years, I was wondering if he was normal.",ELAINE,73,5
4,"Yeah... (2 co-workers enter Elaine's office) Oh Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go. (she hangs up)",ELAINE,73,5
5,"Oh, yeah?",ELAINE,73,5
6,Joel...,ELAINE,73,5
7,Uh... (clears her throat) Rifkin.,ELAINE,73,5
8,Yeah. It's just a coincidence obviously.,ELAINE,73,5
9,Very funny. That's very funny.,ELAINE,73,5
10,All right. Well that's enough of that. That's enough.,ELAINE,73,5
11,"(she's upset, gets up and yells) OK look this is my boyfriend we're talking about OK? And he's a gentlemen, he's good looking, he's a good shaver and he hasn't thrown up in eigth years so just shut up about him! Shut up!",ELAINE,73,5
12,"The whole city is talking about this monster Joel Rifkin, and I am dating a Joel Rifkin.",ELAINE,73,5
13,Yeah. I just wish he has a different name.,ELAINE,73,5
14,You can't ask a person to change their name.,ELAINE,73,5
15,Would you change yours?,ELAINE,73,5
16,"Hey, how many people did Rifkin strangle? Eighteen?",ELAINE,73,5
17,You know Joel and I have an extra ticket to the Giants game.,ELAINE,73,5
18,O.K. I'll leave the ticket for you at will call.,ELAINE,73,5
19,You think I should have asked George?,ELAINE,73,5
20,Karen?,ELAINE,73,5
21,Oh! The Risotto broad.,ELAINE,73,5
22,I tought you didn't like double dates.,ELAINE,73,5
23,I've looked through that window and screamed at him to shut the blinds.,ELAINE,73,5
24,And you're taking...,ELAINE,73,5
25,"Hey, did you get a massage yet?",ELAINE,73,5
26,"Jerry, she gives massages all day. She doesn't wanna to give them on dates.",ELAINE,73,5
27,So what?,ELAINE,73,5
28,(as he touches her) Uhh! What are you doing?,ELAINE,73,5
29,Oh. Huh. Of course. Massaging.,ELAINE,73,5
30,"Yeah, yeah. You know what? There are a lot of players named Deon these days. What a cool name, Deon. If I were gonna change my name, I'd go with Deon.",ELAINE,73,5
31,"Well as a woman, it makes no sense. But, I mean, let's say I was you. And I decided I was gonna change my name for no real reasons whatsoever-- Deon Rifkin. Wow! That is so cool.",ELAINE,73,5
32,"Well maybe you're not the Dion type. O.K. then let's see, let's see, what do we got? (looking at the magazine, she starts to gasp and loses it) Oh! Oh oh oh! O.J.! O.J. Rifkin! You don't even use a name, it's just initials. Oh please please please change your name to O.J.! Please, it would be so great!",ELAINE,73,5
33,"Oh, you have photos in your wallet?",ELAINE,73,5
34,"No, it's normal. You're very normal. You're totally normal. Who's this?",ELAINE,73,5
35,Oh yeah. I see the resemblance.,ELAINE,73,5
36,"Yeah, there is, right here you see--",ELAINE,73,5
37,(pause) Oh. That's nice.,ELAINE,73,5
38,(to the person in front of her) He's not the murderer.,ELAINE,73,5
39,Of course I support your decision to change your name.,ELAINE,73,5
40,"Well, listen, I just want you to know that I was more than willing to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.",ELAINE,73,5
41,(she fakes a strangling) RRR...,ELAINE,73,5
42,Yeah. Yeah. 10 names.,ELAINE,73,5
43,"O.K. And if somebody objects, you can just veto it.",ELAINE,73,5
44,O.K. You start. What's your first choice?,ELAINE,73,5
45,(right away) No. Second choice.,ELAINE,73,5
46,I have never met a normal guy named Stuart.,ELAINE,73,5
47,(repeating to hear how it sounds) Todd. (pause) No. Veto.,ELAINE,73,5
48,Great...,ELAINE,73,5
49,"I gotta tell ya, I have a bad association with the name Alex.",ELAINE,73,5
50,"Yeah, in college I sat next to an Alex in art history. And he was always drinking coffee and after every sip he would go: ""Ahh"". I mean every two seconds: ""Ahh"". And he would take like 40 sips and after everyone: ""Ahh"". I had to drop the class.",ELAINE,73,5
51,What is wrong with Ned?,ELAINE,73,5
52,Ellis.,ELAINE,73,5
53,Ellis and Alex aren't even close.,ELAINE,73,5
54,"Ohh, what is the point?",ELAINE,73,5
55,O.K. O.K. Remy.,ELAINE,73,5
56,"Oh, Stuart's a lot better! (talking like a baby) Little Stuart Rifkin likes to go shopping with his mother.",ELAINE,73,5
0,You know why Rifkin was a serial killer? Because he was adopted. (saying it as he's taking a lot of paper towels from Jerry's roll; Elaine and Jerry are confused at Kramer's statement) Just like Son of Sam was adopted. So apparently adoption leads to serial killing. (Kramer leaves and we don't know why he needed so much paper towels),KRAMER,73,5
1,I'll go.,KRAMER,73,5
2,Yeah! Ooh! (leaves again),KRAMER,73,5
3,Hey! I am looser than creamed corn!,KRAMER,73,5
4,You don't know what you're missing buddy.,KRAMER,73,5
5,"(Kramer is talking much more slowly and smoother than usual) First she sets the mood perfectly with this new age music played over ocean sounds. Then she lays you out on this table, and she proceeds to rub oil over your entire body. And she rubs long... and deep... Jerry, she rubs with love. (Jerry is obviously cutting much harder than the cheese needs it as he listens to Kramer) Every muscles she touches just... (long pause) ooo-zz-es. Beneath those silky, soft fingers, you can scarcely contain yourself, buddy. (Jerry slams down the knife and goes to the couch)",KRAMER,73,5
6,Oh... yeah...,KRAMER,73,5
7,Very... much...,KRAMER,73,5
8,What! (Kramer is back to his usual way of speaking),KRAMER,73,5
9,Wha--,KRAMER,73,5
10,Why?!,KRAMER,73,5
11,Wait a minute! Wait a minute! I need my massages! Can't you see I'm burned out!,KRAMER,73,5
12,"Why? Why? Look, I paid for her. (Jerry stops walking)",KRAMER,73,5
13,But why?,KRAMER,73,5
14,Ah!!! Yahh!!!,KRAMER,73,5
15,"(to the ticket man) Uh, yeah, a ticket for Kramer.",KRAMER,73,5
16,"Oh, yeah. (snaps fingers) You know, I forgot my wallet.",KRAMER,73,5
17,Are you kidding me?,KRAMER,73,5
18,"Come on, just look at me. Tell me I'm not Kramer.",KRAMER,73,5
19,"Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow and I'll show the I.D. I got nothing to do all day.",KRAMER,73,5
20,Where's a phone?,KRAMER,73,5
21,"Oh, God.",KRAMER,73,5
22,"Jerry, I need another massage!",KRAMER,73,5
23,"Because of the Giant game! I told you, It went overtime! You know what those seats are like. They're very unforgiving.",KRAMER,73,5
24,"And then the game-winning field goal went over the net and into the crowd and I dove over three rows! My back, it's killing me! (whining) It's killing me Jerry!",KRAMER,73,5
25,Oh I got the ball.,KRAMER,73,5
26,"Well, It's quite a thrill.",KRAMER,73,5
27,Because nobody does it like she does. She's the best.,KRAMER,73,5
28,What about my massage?,KRAMER,73,5
0,"You can always tell what was the best year of your father's life, because they seem to just freeze that clothing style and just ride it out to the end, don't they? And it's not like they don't continue shopping, it's just they somehow manage to find new old clothes. Every father is like this fashion time capsule, you know what I mean. It's like they should be on a pedestal, with someone next to 'em going 'This was nineteen sixty-five'. To me the worst thing is shopping for pants. I hate dressing and undressing in that little room. What men need is a place to shop where you go in, you check your pants at the door, and you just walk around the store in your underwear. That would be the best way. Then you'd really have to lie to the salesman. 'Need some help?' 'No, just getting some air.'",JERRY,74,5
1,How would you describe the smell in this house?,JERRY,74,5
2,"Yeah, that's part of it. (sniffs) Kasha?",JERRY,74,5

8,"Eh, eh, ah. Winona's gonna be there?",JERRY,74,5
9,(interested) Really?,JERRY,74,5
10,"Thanks, because I would really like... (distractedly puts coffee cup back on the table)",JERRY,74,5
11,"Alright, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (picks it up again)",JERRY,74,5
12,Just put a coffee table book over it.,JERRY,74,5
13,There you go. That'll get you home in time.,JERRY,74,5
14,"I'm sorry Elaine, I'll make it up to you.",JERRY,74,5
15,"(handing her a magazine) Here, read this.",JERRY,74,5
16,"Hey, maybe I should get Elaine something.",JERRY,74,5
17,"Ah, you know, I didn't drive her home. Plus, I give her a gift in front of Winona, how does that hurt me?",JERRY,74,5

26,(whips off bag to reveal Indian) Ta-da!,JERRY,74,5
27,It's a cigar store Indian. (to Elaine) Read the card.,JERRY,74,5
28,Read it out loud.,JERRY,74,5
29,(takes the card from Elaine) We had a little fight this afternoon. (reading from card) Let's bury the hatchet. We smoke um peace pipe.,JERRY,74,5
30,"Hey-yah, ho-ah, hey-yah, ho-ah.",JERRY,74,5
31,"...ho-ah. It's, it's, it's kitschy.",JERRY,74,5
32,She is?,JERRY,74,5
33,"Uh, Winona, it's Jerry Seinfeld.",JERRY,74,5
34,"Uhm, listen, I really felt bad about what happened, and I, I, I'd really like to apologise. Can I come up?",JERRY,74,5
35,"And well it should be. I think if you spent any time with me at all, you'd see I'm very sensitive to these matters as well. You wouldn't be hungry by any chance, wouldya?",JERRY,74,5
36,"You like Chinese food, 'cos I once went to a great Szechwan restaurant in this neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact address... (he spots a mailman crouched emptying a box) Uh, excuse me, you must know where the Chinese restaurant is around here.",JERRY,74,5

38,I didn't know that...,JERRY,74,5
39,"I, I had no idea.",JERRY,74,5
40,"Yeah, did a good job.",JERRY,74,5
41,"You know, I don't get it. Not allowed to ask a Chinese person where the Chinese restaurant is! I mean, aren't we all getting a little too sensitive? I mean, someone asks me which way is Israel, I don't fly off the handle.",JERRY,74,5
42,"Ah, she kinda calmed down. I talked to her today. In fact I'm gonna see her tonight.",JERRY,74,5
43,"Yeah, but I'm a little uncomfortable. I'm afraid of making another mistake.",JERRY,74,5
44,Hello.,JERRY,74,5
45,"Uh, Elaine took it to read on the subway.",JERRY,74,5
46,"Wa, it's two weeks old.",JERRY,74,5
47,You collect TV Guide?,JERRY,74,5
48,I'll see you later. (he leaves with unseemly haste),JERRY,74,5
49,I thought we'd eat at the Gentle Harvest.,JERRY,74,5
50,"Ah, don't worry. I made reser... (catches himself)",JERRY,74,5
51,"I uh, I uh, I arranged for the appropriate accommodations. And then, Knick tickets, floor seats.",JERRY,74,5

55,"Wait a second, you got the Mark McEwan TV Guide.",JERRY,74,5
56,"Oh well, they're both chubby weathermen. I get Dom Deluise and Paul Prudhoe mixed up too. Could I have this?",JERRY,74,5
57,Thanks.,JERRY,74,5
58,"So, Winona had the TV Guide. Told you I'd make it up to you.",JERRY,74,5
59,Yeah. You almost ruined his life's work.,JERRY,74,5
60,Yeah.,JERRY,74,5
61,What'ya do with the one you took?,JERRY,74,5
62,"I thought it was a pretty good idea. It's about coffee tables, it's on a coffee table.",JERRY,74,5
63,Where you going?,JERRY,74,5
64,My Indian?,JERRY,74,5
65,"Well, why would I assume. I never assume. Leads to assumptions.",JERRY,74,5
66,Why?,JERRY,74,5
67,"Well, it's too late. I gave it to Elaine, and she's already on her way to give it to George's father.",JERRY,74,5
68,"You can't give something and then take it back. I mean, what are you... (catches himself)",JERRY,74,5
69,"A uh, a person that uh...",JERRY,74,5
70,"Well, a person that gives something and then they're dissatisfied and they wish they had, had never uh...",JERRY,74,5
71,"...give, given it to the person that they originally gave it to.",JERRY,74,5
72,"I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with that term.",JERRY,74,5
73,I don't know why we didn't think of this before. We just could call TV Guide.,JERRY,74,5
74,"Well, it's gonna make Mr Costanza very happy. (he hands the magazine to Elaine)",JERRY,74,5

78,Elaine!,JERRY,74,5
79,"I was always excited as a kid, when that new TV Guide would come. Somehow when that front cover's nice and flat, seems like there's good fresh TV shows in. Then, as the weeks go by you start to hate the TV Guide. All the shows stink. Everything's getting all crumpled and ripped from being sat on, thrown across the room. TV Guide is always thrown, never handed, to another person. It's the world's most thrown reading material. 'Where's TV Guide?' (mimes throwing) 'There it is.' You know in the back of the TV Guide, they have a phone number, ninety-five cents a minute, they will give you the answers to the TV Guide crossword puzzle? My question is, if you can't do the TV Guide crossword puzzle, where are you coming across ninety-five cents?",JERRY,74,5

93,"Now of the course the thing is Extreme sports. Bungie jumping. To me if Bungie jumping is a sport so is being a crash test dummy. Just leaning does not make it a sport. It's like a Wiley Coyote idea isn't it? The thing I wonder about the sky diving is why do they even bother with the helmets? Can you almost make it? Why don't they just wear a party hat? What's the difference? You jump out of a plane from twenty thousand feet in the air the chute doesn't open I got news for you, the helmet is now wearing you for protection. Later on the helmet's talking to the other helmets going ""boy it's a good thing he was there or I would have hit the ground directly.""",JERRY,76,5

40,"and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!",JERRY,77,5
41,"Uhm, see the key to eating a Black and White cookie, Elaine, is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes better than, vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only *Look to the Cookie* -- all our problems would be solved.",JERRY,77,5
42,Hmm. Look to the cookie Elaine... Look to the cookie.,JERRY,77,5

49,"Who needs that misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. Hundred proof - takes your roots out. (pretends to pull hair out)",JERRY,77,5
50,"Well, maybe we should just forget about the cake?",JERRY,77,5
51,No. Thats out of the question.,JERRY,77,5
52,Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.,JERRY,77,5
53,I'd rather not talk about it.,JERRY,77,5
54,All right . . . . I once found a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.,JERRY,77,5
55,Yeah.,JERRY,77,5
56,"Well I started screaming, ""There's a hair in my farina. There's a hair in my farina."" Then I ran out of the house and I was running and running. And like I was little but I could run very fast. And I-I just kept running (In the background -- CLERKS VOICE: 57) and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.",JERRY,77,5
57,My mother's.,JERRY,77,5

67,Oh my stomach. I feel like I'm going to throw up.,JERRY,77,5
68,"I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.",JERRY,77,5
69,Fourteen years down the drain. (points and walks off -- to the bathroom),JERRY,77,5
70,As good as it gets.,JERRY,77,5

12,All right. All right. (They both leave),GEORGE,79,5

14,"Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?",GEORGE,79,5
15,You think so?,GEORGE,79,5

19,So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?,GEORGE,79,5
20,"Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair. (placing the suit further away in the rack)",GEORGE,79,5
21,"(outside, looking the guy trying the suit through the window, and thinking out loud) What's this? Can't I leave this place for a second? (goes in, take off his jacket, walks to the guy and talks to him with an european accent) Can I help you?",GEORGE,79,5
22,"No, no, no, this suit is not for sale. (tries to take off the suit from the guy)",GEORGE,79,5

39,"Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.",GEORGE,79,5
40,"You're telling me. (he walks around and the suit makes a swooshing sound) So, what do you think?",GEORGE,79,5
41,I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street noise. (he panics) This is no good! I got to meet these guys from MacKenzie for lunch in half an hour!,GEORGE,79,5
42,"This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.",GEORGE,79,5
43,"Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's gonna hire?",GEORGE,79,5
44,"No, I didn't hear anything.",GEORGE,79,5
45,"No, can't say as I did.",GEORGE,79,5
46,Could be the leaves...,GEORGE,79,5
47,I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.,GEORGE,79,5
48,No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.,GEORGE,79,5
49,Oh... (George looks around and sees the chef hiding behind a plant: it's Bob!),GEORGE,79,5

3,"He could be eating a gyro, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's a sickness.",ELAINE,79,5
4,I got a pebble.,ELAINE,79,5

12,It looks exactly like me.,ELAINE,79,5
13,What's going on here? How do you think this happened?,ELAINE,79,5
14,You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?,ELAINE,79,5
15,(to the saleswoman) Excuse me. Where did this come from?,ELAINE,79,5
16,I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?,ELAINE,79,5
17,"(irritated, but still polite) Well, is there somebody around here I could talk to who would know?",ELAINE,79,5
18,Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.,ELAINE,79,5
19,"(upset) Did you just roll your eyes at him? Because let me tell you something, if anobody should be rolling their eyes, it is me at him about you.",ELAINE,79,5
20,"What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous dress? (looking at her name tag) Listen Natasha... I wouldn't be caught dead wearing your crummy little euro-trash rags. (to George) I'll meet you outside.",ELAINE,79,5
21,"So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em up.",ELAINE,79,5
22,"I don't know. They wouldn't tell me. (Jerry is not listening, he's looking at two women sitting in the other booth) Jerry? Je... Hello?",ELAINE,79,5

24,No way!,ELAINE,79,5
25,No.,ELAINE,79,5
26,"Kramer, forget it.",ELAINE,79,5
27,I thought George was meeting us here?,ELAINE,79,5
28,He's guarding a suit?,ELAINE,79,5
29,"So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin. You know, possible suspects.",ELAINE,79,5
30,"There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost put his finger up my nose.",ELAINE,79,5
31,"OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.",ELAINE,79,5
32,Because you have an attitude.,ELAINE,79,5
33,JERRY and ELAINE: Oh!,ELAINE,79,5
34,"Yeah, like a swoosh.",ELAINE,79,5
35,(feels the fabric) It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.,ELAINE,79,5
36,Hmm... No you don't.,ELAINE,79,5
37,The mannequin!,ELAINE,79,5
38,You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in your window!,ELAINE,79,5

3,(to the gang) There's a clothing store downtown. They got a mannequin in there that looks exactly like Elaine.,KRAMER,79,5
4,"It's uncanny! It's like they chopped off your arms and legs, dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together again, and stuck you on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.",KRAMER,79,5
5,Rinitze. (he takes Jerry's spatula and starts rubbing his back with it) Oh yeah...,KRAMER,79,5
6,"It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one my couch cushions didn't have any fabric on it.",KRAMER,79,5
7,Real Boss!,KRAMER,79,5

14,I'm going home to spatula. (picks up the check and walks to the cashier),KRAMER,79,5
15,"Madam, I pray you're not toying with me. (Olive shows her long finger nails) Whoa.",KRAMER,79,5

20,Yeah. My lady friend down at Monks.,KRAMER,79,5
21,"You guys ought to see the way she works her nails across my back. Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross. The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all where anything can happen.",KRAMER,79,5
22,Is that Elaine mannequin still there?,KRAMER,79,5
23,Yeah.,KRAMER,79,5
24,"Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.",KRAMER,79,5
25,"Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.",KRAMER,79,5

28,I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.,KRAMER,79,5
29,"I'll let her down easy. All right. (he gets up and walks to Olive) Well, hi Olive. (she reaches for Kramer's back) No, no. No more of that. There's something I have to tell you.",KRAMER,79,5
30,"Uh, well, there's someone else.",KRAMER,79,5
31,"Yeah, yeah, yeah...",KRAMER,79,5
32,Her. (he points to the Elaine mannequin in Jerry's car),KRAMER,79,5
33,"Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.",KRAMER,79,5
34,"Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.",KRAMER,79,5
35,"Well, it's the style. (turns back to Jerry) Jerry give me the keys. (Jerry throws his keys to Kramer) Well, I guess we're gonna go for a drive now. She really loves that.",KRAMER,79,5

23,Who couldn't.,JERRY,80,5
24,"Oh don't worry, you'll crack. Cracking's inevitable, first you crack then you chuckle. That was the motto with the Russians at the Caesar Leningrad... first you crack then you chuckle. (Fulton looks at him not amused) You know because Leningrad when the Nazis attacked, it wasn't a very happy time... because of the war, famine, plus it was cold, very cold... they were eating each other. (Nervous under the pressure; Fulton not finding anything Jerry is saying funny) Maybe this isn't a good time for a visit.",JERRY,80,5

10,"Well, that doesn't mean anything!",GEORGE,81,5
11,"Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?",GEORGE,81,5
12,"Yeah, you're right, you're right. (To Elaine) Alright, maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask him?",GEORGE,81,5
13,Why?,GEORGE,81,5
14,"Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!",GEORGE,81,5
15,"Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!",GEORGE,81,5
16,I was there! I saw a drain!,GEORGE,81,5

22,"A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?",GEORGE,81,5

2,"No, but I exercised that day. (Laughs.)",ELAINE,81,5
3,"Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people who can say that and mean it. (Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.) Um, do you have the time?",ELAINE,81,5
4,Oh.,ELAINE,81,5

10,"Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you about at the health club?",ELAINE,81,5

12,"I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip kiss.",ELAINE,81,5
13,So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally different dynamic.,ELAINE,81,5
14,"Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But his lower lip landed well below my rim.",ELAINE,81,5
15,Yeah. Definite moisture.,ELAINE,81,5
16,"Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he wants to change our relationship. (The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers it.) Yeah?",ELAINE,81,5
17,"Hey, what happened to you?",ELAINE,81,5
18,"Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.",ELAINE,81,5
19,"Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and uh he ignores me.",ELAINE,81,5
20,"I respect that. (George enters.) Mmm, what happened?",ELAINE,81,5
21,Yeah? What was it?,ELAINE,81,5
22,You went...in the shower?,ELAINE,81,5

24,How do you know?,ELAINE,81,5
25,I can find out.,ELAINE,81,5
26,"Sure. (thinking) Ooh, a project. That's a definite signal.",ELAINE,81,5
27,"Oh, thanks. (thinking) That's no signal, who wouldn't like me in this leotard? I look amazing in this leotard.",ELAINE,81,5
28,"(thinking) Okay, he open-lips me, he dreams about me, we have an olive project...that's it, I'm asking this guy out. (to Greg) Um, you know Greg, I...",ELAINE,81,5
29,"Oh, yeah, sure. (Hands Greg her bottle.)",ELAINE,81,5

32,"Yup, you mean him?",ELAINE,81,5
33,So what do you want me to do?,ELAINE,81,5
34,How can I do that?,ELAINE,81,5
35,"Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just crave my germs!",ELAINE,81,5
36,"George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going out with him.",ELAINE,81,5
37,I...I don't know...,ELAINE,81,5
38,"No, that's not it!",ELAINE,81,5

42,"No, you look pale.",ELAINE,81,5
43,"Hi, Greg.",ELAINE,81,5
44,"Ok. (Another guy approaches the exercise machine.) I got the machine next, buddy. (Greg finishes up his workout and gets off the machine.)",ELAINE,81,5
45,"Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.",ELAINE,81,5
46,"Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.",ELAINE,81,5
47,"Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a signal.",ELAINE,81,5
48,Yeah! It's a social thing.,ELAINE,81,5
49,No! I won't be a party to this.,ELAINE,81,5
50,"Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult position. (Walks away.)",ELAINE,81,5
51,"You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?",ELAINE,81,5
52,Are you sure you want to do that?,ELAINE,81,5
53,You're interested in...in her? (Points at the manager.),ELAINE,81,5
54,"Ah. You know, uh..I'm engaged. (preens) Yep, gettin' married in fifty years. (Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest and winces. George walks by the manager.)",ELAINE,81,5
55,"You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.",ELAINE,81,5
56,"Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?",ELAINE,81,5
57,"Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.",ELAINE,81,5
0,We just got back from breakfast. The pancakes were dynamite.,KRAMER,81,5

0,"Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you think this is funny - (reads comedy he's written) ""Men definitely hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only care what else is on TV.

43,What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?,JERRY,85,5
44,You can see me naked. I can offer you that.,JERRY,85,5
45,I've never been called breathtaking either.,JERRY,85,5
46,Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.,JERRY,85,5
47,How are you gonna do that?,JERRY,85,5
48,You might have.,JERRY,85,5
49,You won't.,JERRY,85,5
50,"Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what you want?",JERRY,85,5
51,"Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some gum.",JERRY,85,5
52,Wait'll you get to know him.,JERRY,85,5

54,"It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.",JERRY,85,5
55,So what?,JERRY,85,5
56,But...,JERRY,85,5
57,Oh... You mean... shrinkage.,JERRY,85,5
58,So you feel you were short changed.,JERRY,85,5

60,"Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.",JERRY,85,5
61,Women aren't like us.,JERRY,85,5
62,"No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides, I think women know about shrinkage.",JERRY,85,5
63,Isn't it common knowledge?,JERRY,85,5
64,GEORGE & JERRY: (Elaine walking down the hall they notice her and wave her into the room) Elaine! Get! (She enters),JERRY,85,5

74,"(Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.",JERRY,85,5

0,I never tasted a cough medicine I didn't love.,GEORGE,85,5

2,Potussan. Ever try it with club soda?,GEORGE,85,5

4,"Yeah, about ten, fifteen minutes. But I have to stop at a vegetable stand.",GEORGE,85,5

19,You mean she just laid there topless?,GEORGE,85,5
20,Walked around? And you looked?,GEORGE,85,5
21,I can't believe that you saw her before me.,GEORGE,85,5
22,"Well, how good a look did you get?",GEORGE,85,5
23,"Well, if she was a criminal and you had to describe her to a police sketch artist...",GEORGE,85,5
24,"Great, great. So anytime you want you can just visualize her naked.",GEORGE,85,5

31,I didn't.,GEORGE,85,5
32,"No, I was just wondering... if you guys, uh, had any gum.",GEORGE,85,5
33,"Yes, because the water was cold... and the chewing warms me up.",GEORGE,85,5
34,Okay. (Chewing) Thanks anyway. (Continues to chew as he exits),GEORGE,85,5
35,(realizing he was short changed) I was in the pool! I was in the pool!,GEORGE,85,5
36,Did she do it on purpose?,GEORGE,85,5
37,I was supposed to see her. She wasn't supposed to see me.,GEORGE,85,5

39,Well I just got back from swimming in the pool. And the water was cold...,GEORGE,85,5
40,Yes. Significant shrinkage.,GEORGE,85,5

42,What if she discusses it with Jane?,GEORGE,85,5
43,How do you know?,GEORGE,85,5
44,"They're worse! They're much worse than us, they talk about everything! Couldn't you at least tell her about the shrinkage factor?",GEORGE,85,5
45,How do women know about shrinkage?,GEORGE,85,5
46,Do women know about shrinkage?,GEORGE,85,5
47,No.,GEORGE,85,5
48,It just does.,GEORGE,85,5
49,"See, look at this. (wearing a very tight shirt) Rachel, my T-shirt shrunk. It used to be much bigger, and now it shrunk. You see, that's what water does. It shrinks things.",GEORGE,85,5
50,"What're you doing? What're you, telling secrets? What're you laughing at?",GEORGE,85,5
51,"You know, it's very impolite to tell secrets. Are you talking about me?",GEORGE,85,5
52,You're going back to New York now?,GEORGE,85,5
53,"Uh huh. Uh huh! I think you spoke to your little friend Rachel, that's what I think.",GEORGE,85,5
54,And she didn't say something to you about a certain something?,GEORGE,85,5
55,"*I* think that *you* think that a certain *something* is not all that it could be, when in fact it is is all that it *should* be, and *more*!",GEORGE,85,5
56,"Look, you don't understand. There was shrinkage.",GEORGE,85,5
57,"Well, I'm just expressing my gratitude to our gracious host.",GEORGE,85,5
58,A little breakfast.,GEORGE,85,5

42,"Well, to tell you the truth, Dr. Feffa, I , I was surprised to hear you use a word like breathtaking to describe a baby, I mean, because you also used it referring to me.",ELAINE,85,5
43,"George, these are the best scrambled eggs I've ever tasted.",ELAINE,85,5
44,"Well, this has turned out to be one *helluva* weekend. (Policeman knocks on door, Michael answers)",ELAINE,85,5

30,"Well, I thought you might wind up around here.",KRAMER,85,5
31,No I'm afraid I couldn't do that.,KRAMER,85,5
32,"Well, that wouldn't be kosher.",KRAMER,85,5
33,"Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.",KRAMER,85,5
34,Heyahhh!,KRAMER,85,5

11,"Well here's your chance to try the opposite. Instead of tuna salad and being intimidated by women, chicken salad and going right up to them.",JERRY,86,5
12,"If every instinct you have is wrong, then the opposite would have to be right.",JERRY,86,5
13,"(on the phone) Are you kidding? They can't cancel that show on me now, it's too late for me to book anything else for that weekend. Alright, alright ... okay, bye. (hangs up the phone)",JERRY,86,5

27,What for?,JERRY,86,5
28,(shocked) What the hell was that?,JERRY,86,5
29,You know you could've thrown a pencil out the window and seen if that came back.,JERRY,86,5
30,"Well, maybe next time someone's in a car accident you won't stop off for candy first.",JERRY,86,5
31,Bad.,JERRY,86,5
32,So you just did the opposite of everything?,JERRY,86,5
33,So I guess your Messiah would be the Anti-Christ.,JERRY,86,5
34,Elaine ... look! A twenty!,JERRY,86,5
35,"I'll tell you what the big advantage of homosexuality is. If you're going out with someone your size, right there you double your wardrobe.",JERRY,86,5
36,"Oh, come on, that's a huge feature. When they approach a new recruit, I'm sure that's one of the big selling points.",JERRY,86,5
37,Yes?,JERRY,86,5
38,Uh huh?,JERRY,86,5
39,"Oh, that's okay.",JERRY,86,5

49,That's a great place!,JERRY,86,5
50,"George, I wouldn't get too excited about this stuff, you know, things have a way of evening out.",JERRY,86,5
51,Hi Elaine.,JERRY,86,5
52,How're things going?,JERRY,86,5
53,Why? Why are they doing that?,JERRY,86,5
54,The jewel thief?,JERRY,86,5
55,What else?,JERRY,86,5
56,"Elaine, don't get too down. Everything'll even out, see, I have two friends, you were up, (has his one hand up and his other hand down) he was down. Now he's up, (switches the positioning of his hands) you're down. You see how it all evens out for me?",JERRY,86,5
57,Is that the end of it?,JERRY,86,5
58,Alright.,JERRY,86,5
59,He knows what he's doing.,JERRY,86,5
60,Opposite.,JERRY,86,5
61,Why'd you have to eat so many?,JERRY,86,5
62,Not to mention the end of Kramer's coffee table book.,JERRY,86,5
63,Don't say that.,JERRY,86,5
64,Ah ... let's call it even.,JERRY,86,5
0,I went to the beach. (Jerry and Elaine exchange looks),GEORGE,86,5
1,"It's not working, Jerry. It's just not working. (sits down next to Elaine)",GEORGE,86,5
2,"Why did it all turn out like this for me? I had so much promise. I was personable, I was bright. (Elaine turns showing disagreement) Oh, maybe not academically speaking, (Elaine nods correct) I was perceptive. I always know when someone's uncomfortable at a party.",GEORGE,86,5
3,"It became very clear to me sitting out there today, that every decision I've ever made, in my entire life, has been wrong. My life is the complete opposite of everything I want it to be. Every instinct I have, in every of aspect of life, be it something to wear, something to eat ... It's all been wrong. (chuckles) Everywhere.",GEORGE,86,5
4,"Yeah. No, no, no, wait a minute, I always have tuna on toast. Nothing's ever worked out for me with tuna on toast. I want the complete opposite of on toast. Chicken salad, on rye, un-toasted with a side of potato salad ... and a cup of tea. (laughs)",GEORGE,86,5
5,(annoyed) Good for the tuna.,GEORGE,86,5
6,So what? What am I supposed to do?,GEORGE,86,5
7,"Elaine, bald men, with no jobs, and no money, who live with their parents, don't approach strange women.",GEORGE,86,5
8,"Yeah, I should do the opposite, I should.",GEORGE,86,5
9,"Yes, I will do the opposite. I used to sit here and do nothing, and regret it for the rest of the day, so now I will do the opposite, and I will do something!",GEORGE,86,5
10,"Excuse me, uh I couldn't help but notice that you were looking in my direction.",GEORGE,86,5
11,My name is George. I'm unemployed and I live with my parents.,GEORGE,86,5
12,Why shave every day? It just grows right back.,GEORGE,86,5
13,"I'm afraid I'm just not interested in how I present myself. If those kind of superficialities are important to you, this probably isn't gonna work.",GEORGE,86,5
14,Take it easy. Take it easy. It's not the end of the world.,GEORGE,86,5
15,That won't be necessary.,GEORGE,86,5
16,"Shut your traps and stop kicking the seats! We're trying to watch the movie! And if I have to tell you again, we're gonna take it outside and I'm gonna show you what it's like! You understand me? Now, shut your mouths or I'll shut 'em for ya, and if you think I'm kidding, just try me. Try me. Because I would love it!",GEORGE,86,5
17,I don't think we should. We really don't know each other very well.,GEORGE,86,5
18,I'm the opposite of every guy you've ever met.,GEORGE,86,5
19,"Hey, I just found twenty dollars! I tell you this, something is happening in my life. I did this opposite thing last night. Up was down, black was white, good was -",GEORGE,86,5
20,Day was -,GEORGE,86,5
21,Yes!,GEORGE,86,5
22,"Yes. And listen to this, listen to this; her uncle works for the Yankees and he's gonna get me a job interview. A front office kind of thing. Assistant to the traveling secretary. A job with the New York Yankees! This has been the dream of my life ever since I was a child, and it's all happening because I'm completely ignoring every urge towards common sense and good judgment I have had. This is no longer just some crazy notion. Elaine, Jerry, this is my religion.",GEORGE,86,5
23,Yes funny (laughs; hand clap) let's go.,GEORGE,86,5
24,Alrighty. Ah ... my last job was in publishing ... I uh got fired for having sex in my office with the cleaning woman.,GEORGE,86,5
25,"Ah, Alright, before that, I was in real estate. I quit, because the boss wouldn't let me use his private bathroom. That was it.",GEORGE,86,5
26,Of course.,GEORGE,86,5
27,"I am different, yeah.",GEORGE,86,5
28,"Well, I wish I could say the same, but I must say, with all due respect, I find it very hard to see the logic behind some of the moves you have made with this fine organization. In the past twenty years you have caused myself, and the city of New York, a good deal of distress, as we have watched you take our beloved Yankees and reduced them to a laughing stock, all for the glorification of your massive ego!",GEORGE,86,5
29,The New York Yankees!,GEORGE,86,5
30,"I'm the assistant to the travelling secretary. I'm going on the road trips with 'em! I'll be on the plane... I'm working in Yankee Stadium! This is a dream, I'm busting, Jerry, I'm busting!",GEORGE,86,5

35,"Well, you could move in with my parents. (chuckles)",GEORGE,86,5
36,Instinct.,GEORGE,86,5
37,"Yeah, it's the last one.",GEORGE,86,5
38,"Alright, let's go.",GEORGE,86,5
39,I'm not gonna be nice. That's how I got the job.,GEORGE,86,5
40,"I just want the both of you to know how much you mean to me, and I love you both very, very much.",GEORGE,86,5
41,"Greetings, people. Greetings. Greetings and salutations. What a beautiful day for a ball game. Let's play two! (Sits down, says to waitress :) Oh, I'll have the chicken salad on rye, my usual, you know what I get, darlin'.

42,"We talked about his new batting stance, you know, I'm not crazy about it, but I said , 'Donny, go with it 'till it stops workin'.' Donny baseball. He's a helluva guy.",GEORGE,86,5

13,Oh. Ok. Thank you.,ELAINE,86,5
14,Could I have a box of Jujyfruits?,ELAINE,86,5
15,"(With her mouth full of Jujyfruit) Oh, that is so terrible. That is so terrible, Jake. I mean, how can people be so stupid? Just sickening.",ELAINE,86,5

25,"Yeah, it got pretty nasty.",ELAINE,86,5

52,"Was that the ... opposite ... of what you were going to say, or was that just your natural instinct? (She squeezes George's mouth between her fingers)",ELAINE,86,5
53,Stick ... with the opposite. (Slaps George on the forehead),ELAINE,86,5
54,"(noticing the forgotten handkerchief tries to stop call for Mr. Lippman with a mouth full of jujifruit) Oh, Mr. Lippman you forgot your handkerchief. Mr. Lippman, you forgot your handkerchief. It's on my desk.",ELAINE,86,5
55,I must've had at least eight in my mouth. I couldn't talk. I couldn't talk!,ELAINE,86,5

3,I'm sorry.,JERRY,87,6
4,"Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?",JERRY,87,6
5,"Right, just like you.",JERRY,87,6
6,"Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any taller. So you're Miss, uh...",JERRY,87,6
7,I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed. (Miss Rhode Island laughs.),JERRY,87,6
8,"Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.",JERRY,87,6
9,"And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and she's going to be down there for the pageant.",JERRY,87,6
10,"The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.",JERRY,87,6
11,"No, it's part of the contest rules.",JERRY,87,6
12,"I don't know, she just sits there.",JERRY,87,6
13,I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. (Picks up the phone and dials.),JERRY,87,6
14,"Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen Hanson?",JERRY,87,6
15,"Of course, they're polyester.",JERRY,87,6
16,Why do they wear polyester?,JERRY,87,6
17,You're going to do something about it?,JERRY,87,6
18,"Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you. You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial. They'll slap that ""Miss Congeniality"" on you, and you'll congene yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're not going? (Kramer enters.) Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey, what are you doing tonight?",JERRY,87,6
19,"I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna go?",JERRY,87,6
20,Rhode Island.,JERRY,87,6
21,"Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.",JERRY,87,6
22,Congratulations!,JERRY,87,6
23,"Now, what is it that you do, exactly?",JERRY,87,6
24,Like what?,JERRY,87,6
25,Really! Socks!,JERRY,87,6
26,"Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! (Kramer enters.)",JERRY,87,6
27,"Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got something else to do and just ""recede into the night,"" if you know what I mean.",JERRY,87,6
28,What?,JERRY,87,6
29,"I'm not going to ""defile"" her!",JERRY,87,6
30,But -,JERRY,87,6
31,But wait a minute...,JERRY,87,6
32,That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -,JERRY,87,6
33,"Alright, Kramer!",JERRY,87,6

35,I'll be right back. (Leaves the table.),JERRY,87,6

38,"And that waist cincher, that was the topper!",JERRY,87,6
39,"Yes, I poo-poo.",JERRY,87,6
40,I don't want to stop her!,JERRY,87,6
41,"Yeah, so do you. (George enters with a newspaper.)",JERRY,87,6
42,See what?,JERRY,87,6
43,"Boy, they really do sound comfortable.",JERRY,87,6
44,I'm working in Atlantic City.,JERRY,87,6
45,"Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come down?",JERRY,87,6
46,"You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. (Picks up the phone.) She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...",JERRY,87,6
47,"Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?",JERRY,87,6
48,"Hey Elaine, it's me.",JERRY,87,6
49,We're going to Atlantic City.,JERRY,87,6
50,"Today, right now! Are you in?",JERRY,87,6
51,Why not?,JERRY,87,6
52,Hey.,JERRY,87,6
53,Good. How was the roulette?,JERRY,87,6
54,"Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!",JERRY,87,6
55,What the hell is that?,JERRY,87,6
56,"Wait a second. (Grabs the icebucket off the counter.) This'll scare 'em off. (Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone. Jerry gets back into bed.) Well, good night, Ollie.",JERRY,87,6
57,What? Why? What happened?,JERRY,87,6
58,Birds?,JERRY,87,6
59,"What are you looking at? (Kramer goes out onto the terrace and looks down.) Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night, because the water was making the room too cold.",JERRY,87,6
60,"No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an accident!",JERRY,87,6
61,"Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! (Kramer exits.)",JERRY,87,6
62,"Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's doves with a bucket of water last night.",JERRY,87,6
63,I heard those doves were really incredible.,JERRY,87,6
64,It's like watching an animal get tortured.,JERRY,87,6
65,"Oh, great! Alright. (We hear the announcers calling the game.)",JERRY,87,6
66,That's a shame.,JERRY,87,6
0,"O.K., Danny, take a swing. (Tartabull swings the bat.) N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.",GEORGE,87,6
1,"No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to hear myself talk. Yes, really!",GEORGE,87,6
2,What are all sweatin' for?,GEORGE,87,6
3,Hot? (Feels Tartabull's material.) What is this?,GEORGE,87,6
4,"This uniform, what's it made from?",GEORGE,87,6
5,"No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. (Tries to look at the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.) Will you stop it? (Looks at the tag.) Oh. Of course. Polyester!",GEORGE,87,6
6,I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.,GEORGE,87,6
7,You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?,GEORGE,87,6
8,"Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.",GEORGE,87,6
9,"Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands. (George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something in his back.)",GEORGE,87,6
10,Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?,GEORGE,87,6
11,You're incredible.,GEORGE,87,6
12,"What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America, Jerry!",GEORGE,87,6
13,"Chaperone? What, are you kidding?",GEORGE,87,6
14,What does the chaperone do?,GEORGE,87,6
15,Can she talk?,GEORGE,87,6
16,You're calling her?,GEORGE,87,6
17,"Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?",GEORGE,87,6
18,"Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those things get? They should be wearing cotton.",GEORGE,87,6
19,I don't know. That's all gonna change.,GEORGE,87,6
20,Why shouldn't I?,GEORGE,87,6
21,How do you know?,GEORGE,87,6
22,"Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?",GEORGE,87,6
23,How's everything going? Everything O.K.?,GEORGE,87,6
24,"Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.",GEORGE,87,6
25,"Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.",GEORGE,87,6
26,"Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're happier - they're gonna play better.",GEORGE,87,6
27,Oh - I've got something.,GEORGE,87,6
28,"Well, did you see it?",GEORGE,87,6
29,"The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments! (reads from the paper) ""Wade Boggs: 'What a fabric! Finally we can breathe.' Luis Palonia: 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill: 'I never dreamed anything could be so soft and fluffy.' """,GEORGE,87,6
30,Really!,GEORGE,87,6
31,Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City. I'm in. I'm down.,GEORGE,87,6
32,Hey.,GEORGE,87,6
33,How was the show?,GEORGE,87,6
34,"I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.",GEORGE,87,6
35,"I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!",GEORGE,87,6
36,Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?,GEORGE,87,6
37,"Good night, Stan.",GEORGE,87,6
38,Oh. (Goes back into the bathroom.),GEORGE,87,6
39,That's a shame. (Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.),GEORGE,87,6
40,"Hey, hey! Yankee game! (Changes the channel.)",GEORGE,87,6
0,"Oh, you want one?",ELAINE,87,6
1,I'll get it. (Reaches in her bag for money.),ELAINE,87,6
2,Jerry!,ELAINE,87,6
3,"Hey, just because I'm not working doesn't mean I haven't got any money. (To vendor) Yo! Dogs! Two!",ELAINE,87,6
4,"Ooh, I gotta check my machine. I'm waiting to hear about an interview. Doubleday is looking for somebody to replace Jackie Onassis.",ELAINE,87,6
5,"Yeah, she was an editor.",ELAINE,87,6
6,Yeah. Can you hold my seat? (Elaine gets up.),ELAINE,87,6
7,"Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have a little grace...not as much as Jackie -",ELAINE,87,6
8,"O.K., fine, I have...no grace.",ELAINE,87,6
9,"Well, I have no intention of ""getting"" grace.",ELAINE,87,6
10,"Yeah, yeah, right.",ELAINE,87,6
11,Justin Pitt?,ELAINE,87,6
12,"""Mrs. Onassis's""? That's hard to pronounce.",ELAINE,87,6
13,Nothing. (Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.),ELAINE,87,6
14,I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...,ELAINE,87,6
15,"Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.",ELAINE,87,6
16,Grace?,ELAINE,87,6
17,You think Ihave grace?,ELAINE,87,6
18,Just some?,ELAINE,87,6
19,"Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.",ELAINE,87,6
20,I attend to his personal affairs.,ELAINE,87,6
21,"Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy him some socks.",ELAINE,87,6
22,Yeah. White ones. Like the ones you wear with sneakers.,ELAINE,87,6
23,"So, what do you think?",ELAINE,87,6
24,You don't like them?,ELAINE,87,6
25,What's wrong?,ELAINE,87,6
26,Too tight?,ELAINE,87,6
27,"Alright, well, I'll just take them back. (The phone rings.)",ELAINE,87,6
28,Sorry. Hello?,ELAINE,87,6
29,Jerry?,ELAINE,87,6
30,Really? When?,ELAINE,87,6
31,"One second, hang on. (To Mr. Pitt) Excuse me, Mr. Pitt? Would it be alright if I got you the socks tomorrow?",ELAINE,87,6
32,Yes.,ELAINE,87,6
33,"Well, it's just one more day.",ELAINE,87,6
34,Because I have to return the socks and get different ones.,ELAINE,87,6
35,I gotta go. (Hangs up.),ELAINE,87,6
36,But what??,ELAINE,87,6
37,But that's why I got you the tighter ones! (Holds them up.),ELAINE,87,6
38,What do you want!?,ELAINE,87,6
0,Nothin.',KRAMER,87,6
1,What state?,KRAMER,87,6
2,They're never in contention.,KRAMER,87,6
3,Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.,KRAMER,87,6
4,Giddy-up!,KRAMER,87,6
5,No way!,KRAMER,87,6
6,"Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing while you defile this woman, you're crazy.",KRAMER,87,6
7,"That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look, Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery of everything the pageant stands for.",KRAMER,87,6
8,"Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! (Jerry tries to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an inch.)",KRAMER,87,6
9,"If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world a better place?",KRAMER,87,6
10,"This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know, poise counts.",KRAMER,87,6
11,"Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.",KRAMER,87,6
12,Tape her breasts together. (Jerry is shocked.),KRAMER,87,6
13,"Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but you got a big waist.",KRAMER,87,6
14,"Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.",KRAMER,87,6
15,"Oh, yeah. Just - thip! - suck you in.",KRAMER,87,6
16,"So, what's your talent?",KRAMER,87,6
17,Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.,KRAMER,87,6
18,"No, five. But you were close.",KRAMER,87,6
19,How's your evening?,KRAMER,87,6
20,Stop right there.,KRAMER,87,6
21,Disaster.,KRAMER,87,6
22,"Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.",KRAMER,87,6
23,"Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we don't play at all.",KRAMER,87,6
24,Hey.,KRAMER,87,6
25,"Oh, come on.",KRAMER,87,6
26,"Oh, you're poo-pooing!",KRAMER,87,6
27,"Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top. To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!",KRAMER,87,6
28,"You can't stop her, Jerry! Oh, I've seen 'em come and go, but this kid has got something! (Turns to leave.)",KRAMER,87,6
29,"No. Alright, watch me now. (Karen sits on the bed. Kramer walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile on his face.) Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see? Posture.",KRAMER,87,6
30,"Let's try a few more questions, alright? (Karen stands up.) If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war, and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep with the enemy's leader, what would you do?",KRAMER,87,6
31,"Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit! Evening wear! Talent! POISE!",KRAMER,87,6
32,What is it?,KRAMER,87,6
33,How did this happen?,KRAMER,87,6
34,Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.,KRAMER,87,6
35,"Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!",KRAMER,87,6
36,Her birds are dead.,KRAMER,87,6
37,"Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry? I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! (Kramer turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.)",KRAMER,87,6
38,"Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in our way, you're crazy!",KRAMER,87,6
39,How ya feelin'?,KRAMER,87,6
40,There's nothing to be nervous about.,KRAMER,87,6
41,Poise. Poise!,KRAMER,87,6
0,Why did you give him MY number?,JERRY,88,6
1,I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?,JERRY,88,6
2,Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?,JERRY,88,6
3,Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's here.,JERRY,88,6
4,Hi Julie.,JERRY,88,6
5,Just had a big bowl of Kix.,JERRY,88,6
6,"Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.",JERRY,88,6
7,Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?,JERRY,88,6
8,People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.,JERRY,88,6
9,"It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.",JERRY,88,6
10,I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,JERRY,88,6
11,What was that?,JERRY,88,6
12,Certainly are.,JERRY,88,6
13,All right. You're in MY face.,JERRY,88,6
14,"(on phone) Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED your pencil.",JERRY,88,6
15,He doesn't even care if a man answers.,JERRY,88,6
16,Bye bye,JERRY,88,6
17,"Well, that all depends. . .",JERRY,88,6
18,"Yeah, so?",JERRY,88,6
19,Is that a fact?,JERRY,88,6
20,No it isn't.,JERRY,88,6
21,Yes you did.,JERRY,88,6
22,She could have.,JERRY,88,6
23,"Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.",JERRY,88,6
24,Obviously.,JERRY,88,6
25,What?,JERRY,88,6
26,"Well, it has nothing to do with you.",JERRY,88,6
27,"Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.",JERRY,88,6
28,And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.,JERRY,88,6
29,"Ah, no , I don't think so.",JERRY,88,6
30,We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.,JERRY,88,6
31,"Oh, they're staring. They know we're on a date. They're making fun. Come on. It's embarrassing.",JERRY,88,6
32,"Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That, that's a long story.",JERRY,88,6
33,Hello Newman.,JERRY,88,6

40,"You liked, Newman?",JERRY,88,6
41,"No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop seeing him.",JERRY,88,6
42,. . . HE ended it?,JERRY,88,6
43,"No, no of course not.",JERRY,88,6
44,What tee?,JERRY,88,6
45,Newman! She went out with Newman!,JERRY,88,6
46,"No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand? He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody. Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing her?",JERRY,88,6
47,"No, there's less.",JERRY,88,6
48,No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.,JERRY,88,6
49,"Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.",JERRY,88,6
50,"No,, but thank you.",JERRY,88,6
51,"Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got your pencil.",JERRY,88,6

54,"Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.",JERRY,88,6

60,Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!,JERRY,88,6
61,"Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?",JERRY,88,6

63,Noit your type?,JERRY,88,6
64,"Well, how come?",JERRY,88,6
65,"What, what is wrong with her?",JERRY,88,6

67,"Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.",JERRY,88,6
68,"No, thank you.",JERRY,88,6
69,But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?,JERRY,88,6
70,What are you so worried about this for?,JERRY,88,6
71,He did?,JERRY,88,6
72,So it had nothing to do with you.,JERRY,88,6
73,"No, I don't think so.",JERRY,88,6

84,. . . I can't.,JERRY,88,6
85,Newman!,JERRY,88,6
86,All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman found this unacceptable.,JERRY,88,6
87,You're going out with the stationery store guy?,JERRY,88,6
88,"Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get out of here. (hangs up) Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey Turnpike.",JERRY,88,6

17,So listen...,JERRY,90,6

37,"Oh. No. What, you mean because of the ""Chang""?",JERRY,90,6
38,I didn't think so.,JERRY,90,6
39,No. Not Chinese. Not even Asian.,JERRY,90,6
40,"Well, she's... like you.",JERRY,90,6
41,"Well, it's false advertising, see? And the thing is, I think she likes people thinkin' she's Chinese. She suggests Chinese food. She always introduces herself as ""Donna Chang""...",JERRY,90,6
42,"Well, she is a woman.",JERRY,90,6
43,Really? (sits on couch),JERRY,90,6
44,"Hey, wouldn't it be funny if Paul an' Noreen broke up because o' you kept hangin' up on him?",JERRY,90,6
45,"Well, you know if Paul thought it was some guy... hangin' up because he was having an affair with Noreen?",JERRY,90,6

56,The rines are crossed?,JERRY,90,6
57,Did I?,JERRY,90,6
58,"Yeah, you know it's a shame his parents didn't get divorced thirty years ago. He could have been normal.",JERRY,90,6
59,"Gee, I never thought of that.",JERRY,90,6
60,Have you ever spent any time with these people...?,JERRY,90,6
61,And you can't cast aspersions on someone just because they're wearin' a cape... Superman wore a cape... An' I'll be damned if I'm gonna stand here an' let you say something bad about him.,JERRY,90,6
62,Well it looks like you've adjusted to the boxers...,JERRY,90,6

68,What are you doin' to this woman?! This is the second relationship you've ruined for her in a few weeks!!,JERRY,90,6
69,First you ruin her relationship with the High Talker.,JERRY,90,6
70,"So she breaks up with him. Somehow picks up the pieces of her life. Miraculously meets... A New Guy! Ya bust that up! An' then, just as they're reconciling, you announce to the world: He's Boring.",JERRY,90,6
71,"Well, apparently you have a tremendous influence over this woman: anything you say she does!",JERRY,90,6
72,Yeah.,JERRY,90,6
73,(hits button) Come on up. (opens door a little),JERRY,90,6
74,"Well, let's look back at your history with this woman. Okay?",JERRY,90,6
75,"First, you encouraged her to join the army... She did.",JERRY,90,6
76,"Then, you suggest she goes... AWOL! She did!",JERRY,90,6
77,You know... You better make sure and never tell this woman to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge...,JERRY,90,6
78,"Oh, Miss Changstein! This is Elaine...",JERRY,90,6
79,Why? What happened?,JERRY,90,6
80,Wow! That's amazing!,JERRY,90,6

4,You didn't ask him?,GEORGE,90,6
5,(suspicious) You didn't say hello?,GEORGE,90,6
6,Why was he wearing a cape?,GEORGE,90,6
7,Was my father wearing a cape?,GEORGE,90,6
8,"Huh... Cape... (turns, distracted, heads slowly towards door) What was a man with a cape doin' with my father?... What was my father doing with a man in a cape?... (opens door) Why a cape? Hmm! (exits)",GEORGE,90,6

20,(smile) Yeah.,GEORGE,90,6
21,Sorry? Why sorry? What you got to be sorry about?,GEORGE,90,6
22,Oh my God! (coming out of bathroom) You know what I just realized?! If they get divorced an' live in two separate places? That's twice as many visits!,GEORGE,90,6
23,Imagine if I had to see them both on the same day? (mirthless) Haha! It's like runnin' a double marathon!,GEORGE,90,6
24,You know what this has to do with?,GEORGE,90,6
25,The man in the cape--I bet you he is mixed up in this! I don't trust men in capes.,GEORGE,90,6
26,All right Superman's the exception.,GEORGE,90,6
27,"All right. (tearing his jacket off) Let me just say one thing: there is no way that this is gonna happen. You hear me? No Way! Because if you think I'm going' to two Thanksgivings, you're out of your mind!!!",GEORGE,90,6
28,"(gleeful, to Estelle) You did?! That's Goood! That's very good! I'm very glad to hear that.",GEORGE,90,6
29,All right. So let me ask you a question. Who was the man in the cape?,GEORGE,90,6
30,Your lawyer wears a cape...?,GEORGE,90,6
31,Who wears a cape?,GEORGE,90,6
32,All right! Come on! Let's not fight.,GEORGE,90,6
33,(quietly) ehh. (pausing to look at both of them) So what made you change your mind?,GEORGE,90,6
34,What?!,GEORGE,90,6
35,So what?! She still gave you advice; what's the difference if she's not Chinese?!?!,GEORGE,90,6
36,(chases after her) Wait a minute! You're--now you're getting a divorce because she's from Long Island?!?!,GEORGE,90,6
37,"Oh, it had to happen!!",GEORGE,90,6
38,"I knew it!! (shuts cab door) I predicted it! (hits cab roof twice, it drives off) Saw both of them today! What a disaster! I'm runnin' all over Queens. First I saw my mother. We had lunch together. Never had... LUNCH with my mother before--it's like a date! Then we drive down to Kew Gardens! Tons of traffic! I see my father. We played ""Clue""! All day with this!

1,Can we rest here a second.,ELAINE,90,6
2,Mmm! She's got a new boyfriend: Paul.,ELAINE,90,6

4,"Yeah! And he is so boring! But now, whenever he answers the phone: I just hang up.",ELAINE,90,6
5,"Oh, yeah, it is! Shall we say hello?",ELAINE,90,6
6,That man he's with: is he wearing a cape?,ELAINE,90,6
7,Why is Mr. Costanza with a man in a cape?,ELAINE,90,6
8,"Yeah, why a cape? Who wears a cape? Where do you even get a cape?",ELAINE,90,6
9,That sounds urgent...,ELAINE,90,6
10,Donna Chang?,ELAINE,90,6
11,Isn't that a little racist?,ELAINE,90,6
12,He's on with a Chinese woman.,ELAINE,90,6
13,You got a comfort problem there?,ELAINE,90,6
14,I thought you wore silk underwear.,ELAINE,90,6
15,"(not charmed) That's nice. Listen, Kramer, you know, if you ever want to have kids you shouldn't wear briefs. Boxers are much better for your sperm count.",ELAINE,90,6
16,A lot!,ELAINE,90,6
17,With the Chinese woman?!,ELAINE,90,6
18,"What, does that conflict with your regular schedule?",ELAINE,90,6
19,(going to the phone) All right. I'm gonna try Noreen again.,ELAINE,90,6
20,She's Chinese so you suggest Chinese food?,ELAINE,90,6

(a little later, Elaine is sitting and looking very bored) Yeah, I took 20% too... Um. Look it uh... (turns hair dryer on and off) Paul. The... car seems to be running out of gas so... I'm gonna... have to get off the phone. (hangs up)",ELAINE,90,6
26,She's not Chinese?,ELAINE,90,6
27,So. What is she?,ELAINE,90,6

40,So you guys are tryin' to work it out! That's great!...,ELAINE,90,6
41,"Oh, he went insane?...",ELAINE,90,6
42,"(awkward, increasingly avoiding eye contact) Well. Uh. I don't know about sick. I mean, maybe it was somebody who, didn't wanna talk to whoever was answering because whoever was answering was always making boring chit-chat, an' was completely oblivious to the fact that the person who was calling, didn't want to speak to them, ah!",ELAINE,90,6
43,"(looks at Noreen) I'm really sorry, Noreen...",ELAINE,90,6

67,"So, ever since she started dating Kramer, she won't even talk to me!",ELAINE,90,6

54,What is his stand...on abortion?,JERRY,91,6
55,How do you know?,JERRY,91,6

6,Nah.,GEORGE,91,6
7,"Okay. ""Breakfast At Tiffany's."" (Begins to read, but gradually his attention is drawn to the TV Guide on the end table. George realizes there's a show on he wants to see by looking at his watch, and doesn't start the book.)",GEORGE,91,6

25,"So, anything to uh, nosh?",GEORGE,91,6
26,Popcorn?,GEORGE,91,6
27,"Well, a lot of people keep popcorn in the house.",GEORGE,91,6
28,"You might want to try it...makes the movie more enjoyable, that's all.",GEORGE,91,6
29,Oh! Nuts! Excellent! You know what I love? How there's two nuts named after people. Hazel...and filbert.,GEORGE,91,6
30,"Hey, let's turn off the lights, get some real 'movie atmosphere.'",GEORGE,91,6

12,"So, he puts the couch down, and just as he's about to leave he says, ""Do you date moving men?""",ELAINE,91,6
13,You wanna know what I said?,ELAINE,91,6
14,"""I do now.""",ELAINE,91,6
15,Is that something?,ELAINE,91,6

19,"Nice to meet you, Poppie.",ELAINE,91,6
20,"Well, your mother must be very proud of you.",ELAINE,91,6

22,Paccino's? Oh no. You should never order pizza from Paccino's.,ELAINE,91,6
23,"Because, the owner contributes a lot of money to those fanatical, anti-abortion groups.",ELAINE,91,6
24,No way.,ELAINE,91,6
25,Yeah.,ELAINE,91,6
26,"Well, I guess I wouldn't eat here, then.",ELAINE,91,6

29,What's wrong with him?,ELAINE,91,6
30,Yeah. You're right.,ELAINE,91,6
31,"Do you know that I have been using the same bottle of shampoo for a year? And I shampoo every day. (Carl smiles.) So, what do you think of my conversation?",ELAINE,91,6

36,"No, I forgot. And, the best part is, he doesn't play games. You know? There are no games! (Sits down on the couch.)",ELAINE,91,6
37,"Well, I'm sure he's pro-choice.",ELAINE,91,6
38,"Because he, well...he's just so good-looking.",ELAINE,91,6
39,Hi. (They kiss.),ELAINE,91,6
40,"Oh, I missed you!",ELAINE,91,6
41,"Me, either!",ELAINE,91,6
42,You do?,ELAINE,91,6
43,"Oh yeah, all the time, all the time...although, recently I've been thinking about this friend of mine.",ELAINE,91,6
44,"Oh, just this woman...she got impregnated by her troglodytic half-brother, and decided to have an abortion. (Waits in suspense for what Carl's response will be.)",ELAINE,91,6
45,Oh my god.,ELAINE,91,6
46,"So, you're gonna get a new couch?",ELAINE,91,6
47,Do you want your old couch back?,ELAINE,91,6
48,Who's that?,ELAINE,91,6
49,"No, no, he's not my boyfriend.",ELAINE,91,6

2,Ooh! Remember Poppie?,KRAMER,91,6
3,"Yeah, yeah. Anyway, uh...we're going into business together. Remember that idea I had a few years ago about the pizza place where you make your own pizza?",KRAMER,91,6
4,"It's a pizza place where you make your own pie! We give you the dough, the sauce, the cheese...you pound it, slap it, you flip it up into the air...you put your toppings on and you slide it into the oven! Sounds good, huh?",KRAMER,91,6
5,"Well, I happened to be eating at Poppie's when I told him the ""old"" idea, and his eyes - waaaaaah! - just lit up. You know, he wants to back it.",KRAMER,91,6
6,"That was in the past, Jerry. As it happens, New York Magazine just judged his kitchen to be one of the cleanest in the city. They got a duck there, you think you died and went to heaven.",KRAMER,91,6
7,"Yeah, but you gotta order it two days in advance. (To Jerry) You know, I'm gonna call him, I'm gonna order the duck for you.",KRAMER,91,6
8,Did you offer those guys a drink?,KRAMER,91,6
9,What kind of a person are you?,KRAMER,91,6
10,"Did you enjoy the duck? (Elaine comes back from the bathroom.) Oh, Elaine! I was just asking how dinner went last night.",KRAMER,91,6
11,"Alright, what did you do to Poppie?",KRAMER,91,6
12,"Well, he's in the hospital. And the cook says you put him there.",KRAMER,91,6
13,"I don't know! I'm gonna go and visit him later. (angrily) It would be nice if you got him something. (Punches the the table to accentuate this, and leaves.)",KRAMER,91,6
14,"Anyway, Jerry and Elaine felt very badly about what happened to you, and they wanted you to have this.",KRAMER,91,6
15,"Why, what...?",KRAMER,91,6
16,"Well, we're not very close.",KRAMER,91,6
17,"Oh, they got good ducks there, huh?",KRAMER,91,6
18,Hey.,KRAMER,91,6
19,"Well, you know, Poppie's over at my place. Tonight's the big night. I'm gonna make the first test pizza at the restaurant.",KRAMER,91,6
20,"Yeah. Anyway, he's about to leave, he wants the duck money. (Poppie enters.)",KRAMER,91,6
21,"Why don't you sit down, Poppie? You're still recuperating. (Poppie moves to the sofa and sits down, and exhales a loud sigh of relief.) What, are you tired, Poppie?",KRAMER,91,6
22,"Hey, Poppie...you really think people wanna make their own pizza?",KRAMER,91,6
23,What is what?,KRAMER,91,6
24,What puddle?,KRAMER,91,6
25,I don't know.,KRAMER,91,6

28,"Ah, you're making too much of it.",KRAMER,91,6
29,Right!,KRAMER,91,6
30,And...cucumbers! (Grabs a large handful and puts them on the pizza.),KRAMER,91,6
31,It's cucumbers.,KRAMER,91,6
32,"Well, why not? I like cucumbers.",KRAMER,91,6
33,"But that's the idea, you make your own pie.",KRAMER,91,6
34,What gives you the right to tell me how I would make my pie?,KRAMER,91,6
35,It's not a pizza until it comes out of the oven!,KRAMER,91,6
36,"No, it isn't!",KRAMER,91,6
0,"I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president, by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and this says what about you?

30,"Well, how about that?",GEORGE,93,6
31,"Yes, I sure did.",GEORGE,93,6
32,"What is that, Boyfriend? I don't understand that. What, what does she think I asked her out for?",GEORGE,93,6
33,"Yeah, yeah, like it's just part of the conversation. Oh my boyfriend really likes watches. He's a real watch freak. We-e-ell that's fabulous. (snaps fingers in the air a couple of times)",GEORGE,93,6
34,"I said, would you like to go for a walk or something.",GEORGE,93,6

38,I think things were going ok. We were having a nice conversation.,GEORGE,93,6
39,I mentioned how I liked horse manure.,GEORGE,93,6
40,Yeah.,GEORGE,93,6
41,Yeah.,GEORGE,93,6
42,"You know, about how when you break it down, it's really a very positive thing. you know, you have a nure, with a ma in front of it. MA-NURE. Iz not bad.",GEORGE,93,6
43,"Yeah. (Jerry nodding) ... Oh, you think because of what I said about the manure. I wa, wa, was just saying how it takes a negative thing, and puts it on a positive spin on it.",GEORGE,93,6
44,So you don't think she really has a boyfriend?,GEORGE,93,6
45,"Well then she's just a Liar, Isn't she?",GEORGE,93,6
46,Well what do you eat?,GEORGE,93,6
47,"Yeah, yeah, yeah we could. You know, ah, Kramer, the next time you talk to her, find out if she knows Kelly, from Monk's. I wanna know if she really has a boyfriend.",GEORGE,93,6
48,"Yeah, yeah, she's here.",GEORGE,93,6
49,"No, but Im very uncomfortable.",GEORGE,93,6

56,Sure you can.,GEORGE,93,6
57,Yeah.,GEORGE,93,6
58,I can't go in there. Im too uncomfortable.,GEORGE,93,6
59,What's the difference? Let's go to Reggies.,GEORGE,93,6
60,It's the same menu.,GEORGE,93,6
61,"They'll make you a Big Salad. What do you think, they're the only one's that make a Big Salad?",GEORGE,93,6
62,So what! Have a yoke! It won't kill you.,GEORGE,93,6
63,"Just tell her whatcha want, they'll make it for ya.",GEORGE,93,6
64,"I mean, it's not fair. I've been going there for 7 years. She's been there 3 weeks.",GEORGE,93,6
65,"If anyone should be forced to leave that place, it should be her!",GEORGE,93,6
66,If only she could get fired. Is there any way that could happen? I mean I know how to get myself fired.,GEORGE,93,6
67,Well ...... but how do I get someone else fired?,GEORGE,93,6
0,"Heyyyyyy (leaning in, very friendly and happy)",ELAINE,93,6

11,"Yeah, what?",ELAINE,93,6
12,What?,ELAINE,93,6
13,Huh. (muttering) This should be interesting.,ELAINE,93,6
14,Nothing.,ELAINE,93,6
15,What kind of soup did he get?,ELAINE,93,6
16,"Consommé, hmm.",ELAINE,93,6
17,"Well, that's not really a meal Jerry. I mean, if he had gotten, Chicken Gumbo, or Matzah Ball, even Mushroom Barley. Then I would agree with you. Those are very hardy soups.",ELAINE,93,6
18,What?,ELAINE,93,6
19,Was it a cup or a bowl?,ELAINE,93,6
20,Im just curious.,ELAINE,93,6
21,Did he crumble any crackers in it?,ELAINE,93,6
22,"(reiterating the question) Did he crumble, any crackers in it?",ELAINE,93,6
23,"Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That -- That could be a meal.",ELAINE,93,6

29,Hi.,ELAINE,93,6
30,"Oh, he'll be right up. He's just getting some beer. And Im not expecting ... any change. (leans forward as she brings her hands together in front of her, then sits on the couch)",ELAINE,93,6
31,"About 2 days. Although he's hinting at how he'd like to stay. Fortunately he has no money, and no prospects. (she smiles)",ELAINE,93,6
32,Thanks,ELAINE,93,6
33,"Hey, What are you doing out here?",ELAINE,93,6
34,Reggies? I can't eat anything there.,ELAINE,93,6

0,"Hey. (walking over to Jerry, who sits at the table reading the newspaper)",KRAMER,93,6
1,"Listen, I need you to do me a favor.",KRAMER,93,6
2,"Well, I need you to help me move my refrigerator.",KRAMER,93,6
3,Cause Im getting rid of it.,KRAMER,93,6
4,(claps hands) So ...,KRAMER,93,6
5,Well after that Kidney Stone I only want fresh food. It's gotta be fresh. Im not eating any more stored food. Plus you know I want the space.,KRAMER,93,6
6,"Well I could put a, dresser in there. I could get dressed while Im making breakfast.",KRAMER,93,6
7,"What, you're giving him this suit?",KRAMER,93,6
8,"Armani? Hey, Armani Jerry. (Kramer takes the suit and looks it over)",KRAMER,93,6
9,"Come on, try it on.",KRAMER,93,6

15,"All right, ooh look at that Armani, huh, yeah.",KRAMER,93,6
16,Hey.,KRAMER,93,6
17,"Ahh, no, no, no. You got me all wrong buddy. I am loving this no refrigerator. You know what I discovered? I really like depriving myself of things. It's fun. Very monastic.",KRAMER,93,6
18,"It's all fresh. Fresh fish, fresh foul, fresh fruit. I buy it, I omniga nominga, I eat it.",KRAMER,93,6
19,"Oh yeah, it's working out. And I got a date with that waitress who works at Reggies.",KRAMER,93,6
20,"Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, well, Ill tell you, she's a full-figured gal.",KRAMER,93,6
21,"Oh you better believe it buddy. Hey George, we could double sometime.",KRAMER,93,6
22,All right it's done.,KRAMER,93,6
23,"(to George) Hey, I just spoke to ah, Hilde about your friend.",KRAMER,93,6
24,She doesn't have a boyfriend. She made it up.,KRAMER,93,6
25,Hey.,KRAMER,93,6

27,"Good, ah, (clap) what's going on?",KRAMER,93,6
28,Really.,KRAMER,93,6
29,"It's not for me. It's for Hilde -- the waitress I was telling you about. She's hungry, she wants food. If I go back in there without any food ... there's gonna be trouble. (his voice gets really high pitched on his last sentence)",KRAMER,93,6
30,Thanks buddy. (goes over to the fridge and pulls out a few things),KRAMER,93,6
31,"Uh, yeah, ah ...",KRAMER,93,6
32,"There's a few things in here, ah, peanut butter, cheese, yeah ...",KRAMER,93,6
33,"Uh, Swiss.",KRAMER,93,6
34,H-Hey. She's hungry Jerry.,KRAMER,93,6
35,No food? Well you gotta have something -- (rummages through Jerry's cupboards and refrigerator) -- I can't go back in there with no food. She's expecting something Jerry. You don't know what she's like when that blood sugar drops.,KRAMER,93,6
36,"There, you see. She's already in a bad mood. She just got fired.",KRAMER,93,6
37,"Oh, because I called over there a couple of times and the manager didnt like it.",KRAMER,93,6
0,"Okay, Tim. You're welcome. (Hangs up.)",JERRY,94,6
1,"Yes, it was. He wanted your address - you, my friend, are going to be invited to his night-before-Thanksgiving party. (Elaine raises her hands triumphantly, then gleefully struts her way to the kitchen.) You know, he's got that great apartment on 77th street, and they overlook where they inflate all those huge balloons for the Macy's Thankgiving Day Parade?",JERRY,94,6
2,"Oh, he's a dentist. You don't want to go out with a dentist.",JERRY,94,6
3,"He'll always be criticizing your brushing technique, it'll drive you crazy. (Mimics brushing his teeth) Away from the gums... (The door opens a little, George jangles the keys to his new car at Jerry and Elaine, then enters.)",JERRY,94,6
4,Uh - new car!,JERRY,94,6
5,Hey! Did you get the Volvo?,JERRY,94,6
6,I thought Consumer said Volvo was the car.,JERRY,94,6
7,Alright. Seems like...a strange choice.,JERRY,94,6
8,You bought a car because it belonged to Jon Voight?,JERRY,94,6
9,"I think yes, yes. You like the idea of telling people you're driving Jon Voight's car.",JERRY,94,6
10,Hey.,JERRY,94,6
11,I really don't wear the kind of shoes that have to be cobbled.,JERRY,94,6
12,"Alright, take 'em.",JERRY,94,6
13,"I like Jon Voight. Just seems like kind've a strange reason to buy a car, because he might have driven it.",JERRY,94,6
14,I don't know.,JERRY,94,6
15,"Don't you see, that's the genius of it. If he had said Liam Neeson, you'd know he's making it up.",JERRY,94,6
16,"Oh, look at this, I stepped in gum.",JERRY,94,6
17,Let me get a clean pair. (Goes into his room. George strides over to the window.),JERRY,94,6
18,Not all of 'em!,JERRY,94,6
19,Obviously. So what am I supposed to wear?,JERRY,94,6
20,I can't wear these!,JERRY,94,6
21,They're uncomfortable.,JERRY,94,6
22,"I worked a club in Dallas one time and they couldn't afford to pay me so they gave me these. Oh, I can't wear these! (Stands up.) They look ridiculous!",JERRY,94,6
23,But I don't wanna be a cowboy!,JERRY,94,6
24,Oh yeah? Huh.,JERRY,94,6
25,"No, nothing.",JERRY,94,6
26,"No, it's just that I, uh...didn't get one.",JERRY,94,6
27,"Ah, but he called me up and he asked for yours and Elaine's addresses, I'm sure that means I'm invited.",JERRY,94,6
28,"Hey, why would you call someone up and ask them for two addresses if you're not invited to the party?",JERRY,94,6
29,"C'mon, put the top up, it's November!",JERRY,94,6
30,"Let's check out the glove box. (Opens the glove compartment, takes out a pencil.) Ah. Pencil.",JERRY,94,6
31,With Jon Voight's teeth marks. (Looks at the owner's manual.) Owner's manual...you know what? This car was owned by Jon Voight.,JERRY,94,6
32,Except Jon is spelled with an H. J-O-H-N.,JERRY,94,6
33,Doesn't Jon Voight spell his name J-O-N?,JERRY,94,6
34,"Nothing. I'm sure ""Jon"" probably mispelled his own name. I know sometimes I spell Jerry with a G...and an I! (Laughs uproariously.)",JERRY,94,6
35,What?,JERRY,94,6
36,And Barbara Mandrell's skateboard!,JERRY,94,6
37,"No, they didn't even touch me. I tripped because of these stupid cowboy boots.",JERRY,94,6
38,You really seemed to enjoy it.,JERRY,94,6
39,"Ah! What'd you find out, Lois?",JERRY,94,6
40,Yeah...,JERRY,94,6
41,So...?,JERRY,94,6
42,"Alright, but let me ask you this question.",JERRY,94,6
43,"Which word did he emphasize? Did he say, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" or, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?"" You emphasize ""Jerry"" or ""bring.""",JERRY,94,6
44,"You know what? The hell with this party, I don't even want to go to begin with. (Kramer enters.)",JERRY,94,6
45,"Hey, so where's my sneakers?",JERRY,94,6
46,What do you mean?,JERRY,94,6
47,So all my sneakers are gone?,JERRY,94,6
48,Mom and Pop aren't even a Mom and Pop?!,JERRY,94,6
49,Where ya goin'?,JERRY,94,6
50,Why does he want to hold a rope underneath Woody Woodpecker in the Thanksgiving Day Parade?,JERRY,94,6
51,"No Jon Voight Day, huh?",JERRY,94,6
52,"Yeah, it's all swollen. I think I may have chipped a tooth when I fell yesterday.",JERRY,94,6
53,"I'm calling dentists all day here, there's nobody working the day before Thanksgiving.",JERRY,94,6
54,"No, I don't know if I'm invited.",JERRY,94,6
55,"Yeah, you're right.",JERRY,94,6
56,"Yeah, I gotta see a dentist, this is killin' me. Well, I'll take a chance. We'll go together.",JERRY,94,6
57,You don't want to go with me?,JERRY,94,6
58,"The way I feel when I go places with you? (Kramer enters.) Hey, so'd you find my sneakers yet?",JERRY,94,6
59,What?,JERRY,94,6
60,"Well, what is he, a vampire?",JERRY,94,6
61,"Oh, please.",JERRY,94,6
62,"No, it's stupid.",JERRY,94,6
63,So you're gonna show up at that party with a chewed-up pencil and Kramer's gnarled arm.,JERRY,94,6
64,"So, Kramer, you wanna go to the party together?",JERRY,94,6
65,"Hey, Elaine. Did you get my message?",JERRY,94,6
66,"Elaine, would you marry me?",JERRY,94,6
67,Alright. Forget it.,JERRY,94,6
68,"Hey, Tim.",JERRY,94,6
69,"Did you say, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show"" or, ""Jerry, I didn't think you'd show""? (Elaine comes over.)",JERRY,94,6
70,Just a quick peek. I'm in agony.,JERRY,94,6
71,"Especially that big kid up in the front. (Mr. Pitt is shown on the television, trying to hold up the deflating Woody balloon.) How old is he? (The phone rings.) Hello?",JERRY,94,6
72,Yes it is.,JERRY,94,6
73,"Can I have the address of that garage sale? Okay, thank you very much. (To Kramer) I found Mom and Pop, they're sellin' my sneakers!",JERRY,94,6
74,"Parsippany, New Jersey.",JERRY,94,6
75,My car's in the shop.,JERRY,94,6
0,"I don't think so, Vic. I've done my homework. '89 Volvo, that's the car for me, it's the one I want.",GEORGE,94,6
1,"No, I decided to go with an '89 LeBaron.",GEORGE,94,6
2,What Consumer? I'm the consumer.,GEORGE,94,6
3,"Well, maybe so...but it was good enough for Mr. Jon Voight.",GEORGE,94,6
4,"Alright, maybe I do. So what.",GEORGE,94,6
5,"I like (imitates Kramer) ""cookies.""",GEORGE,94,6
6,"Well, what's so great about a Mom and Pop store? Let me tell you something. If my Mom and Pop ran a store, I wouldn't shop there.",GEORGE,94,6
7,You are gonna love this car. Even if you don't like Jon Voight.,GEORGE,94,6
8,"What do you mean ""might""? You don't think he really owned this car?",GEORGE,94,6
9,"Well, why would the guy make up something like that? Of all the names he could pick, why settle on Jon Voight?",GEORGE,94,6
10,"Neeson? How are you comparing Liam Neeson with Jon Voight? Jerry, we're talking about Joe Buck. If you can play Joe Buck, Oskar Schindler's a cake walk. (Opens the car door for Jerry, Jerry's about to get in.)",GEORGE,94,6
11,"Whoa, whoa, you're not getting in my car with gummy shoes.",GEORGE,94,6
12,Where did you get those?,GEORGE,94,6
13,"Yeah, I got one too.",GEORGE,94,6
14,What?,GEORGE,94,6
15,"No, what is it?",GEORGE,94,6
16,You didn't get one?,GEORGE,94,6
17,So?,GEORGE,94,6
18,"I feel alive, Jerry.",GEORGE,94,6
19,"Hey...you don't think...sure, that's Jon Voight's pencil!",GEORGE,94,6
20,Ah! See? I told ya.,GEORGE,94,6
21,So?,GEORGE,94,6
22,"That's right, you heard me. Get out! You are ruining this whole experience for me!",GEORGE,94,6
23,Get out!,GEORGE,94,6
24,Get out!! (Jerry gets out and George drives away. A couple of guys notice Jerry in his cowboy boots.),GEORGE,94,6
25,Did they take anything?,GEORGE,94,6
26,"Anyway, again, I'm sorry about throwing you out of the car.",GEORGE,94,6
27,"It was kinda fun. (Elaine gives Jerry a cold cloth for his jaw.) You know, maybe his name really is J-O-H-N, but he changed it to J-O-N for show business. Well, you know, J-O-N is a lot zippier.",GEORGE,94,6
28,"How would you find out something like that...wait a minute, what am I thinking? I've got the entire Yankee organization at my disposal.",GEORGE,94,6
29,"Heh, that's right. See ya later. (Exits.)",GEORGE,94,6
30,"Well, I think we need more special days at the stadium, you know? Like, uh...Joe Pepitone Day. Or, uh...Jon Voight Day.",GEORGE,94,6
31,"I suppose if I had suggested Liam Neeson Day, you'd all be patting me on the back.",GEORGE,94,6
32,"No. Now I'll always have this doubt about the car. What, your jaw still hurts?",GEORGE,94,6
33,You should have somebody take a look at that.,GEORGE,94,6
34,You going to the party?,GEORGE,94,6
35,"Well, there's going to be a lot of dentists there.",GEORGE,94,6
36,You don't want to suffer with this all weekend.,GEORGE,94,6
37,Maybe I'll just meet you there.,GEORGE,94,6
38,"Jerry, for all I know this guy went out of his way to not invite you. How am I gonna feel if I show up with an uninvited, unwelcome intruder?",GEORGE,94,6
39,Jon Voight! Are you kiddin' me? Did you talk to him?,GEORGE,94,6
40,"What, you didn't ask him about the car?",GEORGE,94,6
41,Jon Voight bit you?,GEORGE,94,6
42,"Wait a minute, wait, it's not that stupid.",GEORGE,94,6
43,"Why? Why isn't it possible? I mean, they're both bite marks.",GEORGE,94,6
44,It's worth a shot. (Goes to the door.),GEORGE,94,6
45,"These are the balloons? Big deal, all I see is Woody Woodpecker.",GEORGE,94,6
46,"Yeah, what is he? Some sort of an instigator?",GEORGE,94,6
47,"Hey, Tim.",GEORGE,94,6
48,"Watch the arm! Tim, listen, we don't want to bother you, we know you're busy here.",GEORGE,94,6
49,"Let me show you something, take a look at this... (Another guy at the party interrupts.)",GEORGE,94,6
50,"Uh, Tim, the pencil...",GEORGE,94,6
51,Let me ask you something. Could you tell if teeth marks on someone's arm matched teeth marks on a pencil?,GEORGE,94,6
52,That's right. I got his whole car downstairs.,GEORGE,94,6
53,"Jon Voight, the actor?",GEORGE,94,6
0,Was that Tim Whatley?,ELAINE,94,6
1,I have always had a big crush on Tim Whatley. Why can't he ask me out? (Punctuates this by shoving Jerry.),ELAINE,94,6
2,Why?,ELAINE,94,6
3,Ohhh!,ELAINE,94,6
4,A LeBaron?,ELAINE,94,6
5,Jon Voight? The actor?,ELAINE,94,6
6,"I've never even seen him in a car. I mean, look at his movies. No cars. Deliverance - canoe. Midnight Cowboy - boots. Runaway Train...runaway train. (Kramer enters.)",ELAINE,94,6
7,I like coffee.,ELAINE,94,6
8,"Yes, Mr. Pitt?",ELAINE,94,6
9,"No, I'm still working on it.",ELAINE,94,6
10,"Artie Shaw. ""Honeysuckle Jump."" (The song ends.)",ELAINE,94,6
11,"Oh, my father used have a huge collection of big band records.",ELAINE,94,6
12,"Mr. Pitt, why would you want to hold onto the ropes on the Woody Woodpecker balloon?",ELAINE,94,6
13,"Oh. Alright, I'll do the best I can. (Turns up the radio.)",ELAINE,94,6
14,Will you shut up? I can't hear!,ELAINE,94,6
15,"Oh! I've got it! It's ""Next Stop Pottersville""! (Grabs the phone to call it in.)",ELAINE,94,6
16,"So Jerome, I did a little snooping around for you.",ELAINE,94,6
17,"Well, I talked to Tim Whatley...",ELAINE,94,6
18,"And I asked him, ""Should Jerry bring anything?""",ELAINE,94,6
19,"Mmmm...and he said, ""Why would Jerry bring anything?""",ELAINE,94,6
20,What?,ELAINE,94,6
21,"I think he emphasized ""would.""",ELAINE,94,6
22,"Alright, that's enough of this.",ELAINE,94,6
23,I gotta go to the Dixieland Deli to pick up Mr. Pitt's security pass for the parade.,ELAINE,94,6
24,"He finds his laugh ""intoxicating."" (Laughs like Woody Woodpecker, and exits.)",ELAINE,94,6
25,"Um, it was, uh...""Next Stop Pottersville."" (The group is unimpressed.) Uh, do you know when they're giving out the passes?",ELAINE,94,6
26,What? I can't hear a word you're saying. I was stuck at the Dixieland Deli all day. My head is still ringing. Where's Tim?,ELAINE,94,6
27,What? I can't hear you.,ELAINE,94,6
28,"I told you, I can't hear a word.",ELAINE,94,6
29,Tim.,ELAINE,94,6
30,What?,ELAINE,94,6
0,Hey.,KRAMER,94,6
1,"Jerry, you know that shoe repair place at the end of the block? Well, if they don't get some business, they're gonna have to shut down and make way for one of those gourmet coffee or cookie stores.",KRAMER,94,6
2,"Yeah, of course you do. And do you know why? Because you're a bunch of yuppies. It's your go-go corporate takeover lifestyles that are driving out these Mom and Pop stores and destroying the fabric of this neighborhood.",KRAMER,94,6
3,"Hey, Bogambo - they've been in the neighborhood for 48 years. Now, come on, Jerry. You've gotta have a pair of shoes in need of a cobblin.'",KRAMER,94,6
4,"Well, what about sneakers? You know, they'll clean 'em. They do complete detailing.",KRAMER,94,6
5,"Well you know, these sneakers, they belong to my neighbor, Jerry Seinfeld? The comedian.",KRAMER,94,6
6,"Well, he's got a Peter Pan complex.",KRAMER,94,6
7,"Oh, well, no rush. (wipes his nose) Uh oh.",KRAMER,94,6
8,"Oh, I keep getting these nosebleeds.",KRAMER,94,6
9,"Yeah. (Lies on the couch and cracks the back of his head against the armrest.) Hey, what's with your ceiling? (Mom and Pop look up.)",KRAMER,94,6
10,"Yeah well, you should. This place could blow any minute.",KRAMER,94,6
11,You said take 'em.,KRAMER,94,6
12,"Well, obviously there was a miscommunication.",KRAMER,94,6
13,"Jerry, I left you a pair right here...(goes into Jerry's room and comes out with a pair of cowboy boots.) C'mon. There, put on those boots.",KRAMER,94,6
14,"Well, why not?",KRAMER,94,6
15,"C'mon here, try 'em on. (Jerry sits down and puts the boots on.)",KRAMER,94,6
16,"Ah, you look like a cowboy! Huh?",KRAMER,94,6
17,"Oh, stop it. You know that friend of yours, Tim the dentist? I got an invitation to his Thanksgiving Eve party.",KRAMER,94,6
18,Yeah?,KRAMER,94,6
19,Not necessarily.,KRAMER,94,6
20,"Afternoon, Mom! Afternoon, Pop. You know you got a crack in the sidewalk out there? Now, you oughta get that fixed.",KRAMER,94,6
21,Hey.,KRAMER,94,6
22,That's what I wanna know.,KRAMER,94,6
23,"Well, I saw Mom and Pop this morning, but when I went by the store on my way home? The place was empty. Everything is gone. Mom and Pop - vrooop - vanished.",KRAMER,94,6
24,I'm afraid so. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. I've been asking around - they didn't even have any kids.,KRAMER,94,6
25,"It was all an act, Jerry. They conned us, and they scored, big time.",KRAMER,94,6
26,Apparently.,KRAMER,94,6
27,Oh. Oh man. (Takes out a Kleenex and puts his head back. Jon Voight comes out of a doorway and hails a cab.),KRAMER,94,6
28,"Hey! Jon Voight! Jon Voight! (Voight waves at Kramer and hurriedly gets in the cab. Kramer runs over to the car.) Hey, listen, can I ask you something? Listen, listen...(Leans in the the open back window of the cab. Defensively, Voight grabs Kramer's arm and bites it. Kramer screams. The cab speeds off leaving Kramer in the street, stunned.)",KRAMER,94,6
29,"No. (To George) But I did run into somebody you might be interested in, a Mr. Jon Voight, the actor?",KRAMER,94,6
30,"Well, he was a little standoffish.",KRAMER,94,6
31,"No, I couldn't, his cab pulled away. But he did, however, make an impression on me. (Pulls up his sleeve and shows George his arm.) Look.",KRAMER,94,6
32,His tooth marks. He bit me.,KRAMER,94,6
33,"No, it's justifiable. He thought I was going for his wallet.",KRAMER,94,6
34,"That he did. Now, you got that pencil with the bite marks on it? We get a trained eye to match 'em up, and we'll see whether or not you're driving Jon Voight's car!",KRAMER,94,6
35,"Jerry, look, come on, I'm an invited guest. I can't be aiding and abetting some...party-crasher.",KRAMER,94,6
36,You got a problem with Woody Woodpecker?,KRAMER,94,6
37,That's right. He's a troublemaker.,KRAMER,94,6
38,He didn't come with us. (Tim walks over to Jerry.),KRAMER,94,6
39,Not just someone. Jon Voight.,KRAMER,94,6
40,Oh! You popped Woody Woodpecker!,KRAMER,94,6
41,Those kids look pretty disappointed.,KRAMER,94,6
42,Where are they?,KRAMER,94,6
43,Let's go!,KRAMER,94,6
44,"Well, how are we getting to Parsippany?",KRAMER,94,6
45,Uh. Jerry. These nosebleeds are starting again.,KRAMER,94,6
0,That's incredible. Six months ago you were taking messages for your mother.,JERRY,95,6
1,From your mother.,JERRY,95,6
2,"So this ah, woman you plan on hiring, is she going to be in the Spokes model category?",JERRY,95,6
3,"That's a 180, George.",JERRY,95,6
4,Hi Willie.,JERRY,95,6
5,I got this stuff and ah my mother's fur coat for storage.,JERRY,95,6
6,"Ah, she keeps it in my apartment for when she comes up from Florida.",JERRY,95,6
7,Hi.,JERRY,95,6
8,"Yeah, that's why I said hi.",JERRY,95,6
9,Thanks. It's Hounds-Tooth.,JERRY,95,6
10,"Oh yes, it really accentuates my bust line.",JERRY,95,6
11,Yeah.,JERRY,95,6
12,"So you're saying, Store -- Hotsy-Totsy, Home-- Hotsy-Notsy.",JERRY,95,6
13,I thought we were going to the movies?,JERRY,95,6
14,Because you didnt have a job?,JERRY,95,6
15,A lesser man would have crumbled. They would have gone for the dish and the sure fire sexual-harassment suit.,JERRY,95,6
16,It's a little ...,JERRY,95,6
17,You got no waist in that thing.,JERRY,95,6
18,How fast was she walking?,JERRY,95,6
19,"No. I think it's Demi. (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")",JERRY,95,6
20,What?,JERRY,95,6
21,"Oh, you're crazy.",JERRY,95,6
22,Do it tomorrow. Well go to the movies.,JERRY,95,6
23,"Well, that was the worst.",JERRY,95,6
24,"Yeah, I think I do.",JERRY,95,6
25,"Well, all I got is my dry-cleaning stub.",JERRY,95,6
26,Uma Therman? Really?,JERRY,95,6
27,"He's got the Kavorca. (looking towards the theater door, Jerry notices one of the movie goers) Hey, isn't that Willie, my dry-cleaner?",JERRY,95,6
28,"He just went in. You know, I think he was wearing my Hounds-Tooth jacket.",JERRY,95,6
29,It looked just like the jacket I brought in to be dry-cleaned. He complimented me on it.,JERRY,95,6
30,"So you're having sex and then all of a sudden, you just blurt out Im giving you a raise.",JERRY,95,6
31,Just a quick sidebar here -- are you in anyway authorized to give raises?,JERRY,95,6
32,"So you're so grateful to have sex, that you'll just shout out anything that comes into your head.",JERRY,95,6
33,Well maybe she'll just think it was bawdy talk.,JERRY,95,6
34,Maybe you could have sex with her again and then take it back.,JERRY,95,6
35,"All right, all right. Im sorry.",JERRY,95,6
36,How long has she been there?,JERRY,95,6
37,It's almost a week.,JERRY,95,6
38,"Oh, My god.",JERRY,95,6
39,"It's a movie stub from the 9:30 show. George, I think Willie the dry-cleaner has been wearing my clothes.",JERRY,95,6
40,"Hello, Willie.",JERRY,95,6
41,"No, but ah, seen any good movies lately?",JERRY,95,6
42,"Yeah. Specifically 9:30 shows. Seen any good 9:30 shows at the Paragon, Willie?",JERRY,95,6
43,I saw you the other night stepping out with my Hounds-Tooth jacket.,JERRY,95,6
44,You need a code to tell you not to wear peoples clothes,JERRY,95,6
45,"Yeahhh, am I imagining this? (he whips out the movie stub and holds it up to Willie) Found this little cutie in the pocket. (throws the stub on the counter)",JERRY,95,6
46,"Yeah, Yeah. Well, now that we understand each other -- Ill be taking my business elsewhere. And I want my mother's fur coat back too.",JERRY,95,6
47,Now.,JERRY,95,6
48,"Yeah. I want that coat. (Jerry opens his wallet, looking for the dry-cleaning ticket)",JERRY,95,6
49,"Where's that ticket? Oh, Kramer.",JERRY,95,6
50,"No, not on me.",JERRY,95,6
51,Why? I've got my cleaning before without a ticket.,JERRY,95,6
52,"All right, Ill be back.",JERRY,95,6
53,"(to the Barneys sales associate) Excuse me, could you tell me where I could find, like, women's moisturizer lotions?",JERRY,95,6
54,Kramer?,JERRY,95,6
55,What clothes?,JERRY,95,6
56,No.,JERRY,95,6
57,What am I doing here? You're in the women's dressing room. I need that ticket stub back so I can get my mother's fur coat out.,JERRY,95,6
58,Where are your pants?,JERRY,95,6
59,What? You sold your pants to Bania. Let me in.,JERRY,95,6
60,Why'd you sell your pants to Bania?,JERRY,95,6
61,Where are your clothes?,JERRY,95,6
62,You mean what you were wearing?,JERRY,95,6
63,How'd you expect to get out of here?,JERRY,95,6
64,[Elaine],JERRY,95,6
65,"Im going out. (he comes out of the dressing room, while Kramer remains inside)",JERRY,95,6
66,Bania.,JERRY,95,6
67,(to Bania) Excuse me. (he goes back in the dressing room),JERRY,95,6
68,"Never mind Uma, I need that ticket to get my mother's fur coat back. Why don't you just give him the money for the suit?",JERRY,95,6
69,I got an idea.,JERRY,95,6
70,I cant believe Im gonna do this. (Jerry opens the door and exits the dressing room. He walks over to Bania),JERRY,95,6
71,Bania can I talk to you for a second? How's everything going?,JERRY,95,6
72,"Yeah, well, see the thing of it is, Im in a bit of an awkward position here. Because, uhh, I don't want to get in between you two guys but ... I need a dry-cleaning ticket that's in the pocket of those pants.",JERRY,95,6
73,"Yeah, yeah all right, well uh ... tell you what I will do Bania -- you give me the ticket, and uh, I will take you out for a nice dinner.",JERRY,95,6
74,"You want to go to Mendys, Ill take you to Mendys.",JERRY,95,6
75,"all right lets be reasonable, Bania. Im taking you out for a nice dinner. All I want is a little ticket in that pocket. I think it's a pretty good deal.",JERRY,95,6
76,. . . All right (gritting teeth) Just give me the ticket.,JERRY,95,6
77,Ohh ... (takes the ticket and heads for the dressing room),JERRY,95,6
78,"Let me in, it's me. (Kramer opens the door, Jerry goes in the dressing room) Here. You don't know what this is costing me. (hands Kramer the ticket)",JERRY,95,6
79,"(Takes the ticket back and looks at it, flips it over) The dry-cleaning numbers are gone too.",JERRY,95,6
80,(grabs the ticket back) Give me that.,JERRY,95,6
81,"Hey Bania, the dinners off. The ticket's no good. The numbers are all smudged out. (holds out the ticket and hands it to Bania)",JERRY,95,6
82,The ticket is worthless.,JERRY,95,6
83,"Hey, Isn't that my mother's fur coat?",JERRY,95,6
84,It is! (Jerry walks forcefully into the dressing room and closes the door) Give me that back.,JERRY,95,6
85,"You cant have that coat, it's not yours.",JERRY,95,6
86,What do you think the dry-cleaners is your own personal closet!,JERRY,95,6
87,"Yeah, it's very good. (reluctantly)",JERRY,95,6
88,Yeah. Im having a wonderful time. (it's obvious he isn't),JERRY,95,6
89,"(Interrupting Bania) Yeah, yeah I know. This would be good, but it would be the same. But if we go some place else, it would be different, but it might not be as good. It's a gamble. I get it.",JERRY,95,6
90,"Oh, and who might that be?",JERRY,95,6
91,"If you are a waitress and you ever see me in a restaurant, Im telling you right now, I don't want to hear about the specials. I don't want to know about the specials. Im sick of the specials. I hate the specials. My feeling is, if the specials were so special, they'd be on the menu. You know what's special about them? They don't know if anybody likes them. They always have these overly creative descriptions of the specials too, you know. The veil is lightly slapped, and then sequestered in a one-bedroom suite with a white wine intravenous.",JERRY,95,6
0,Well I am actually going to have a secretary and I get to do the interview.,GEORGE,95,6
1,"Yeah, and now someone's going to be taking messages for me.",GEORGE,95,6
2,"Sure. I could go the tomato route. But eh, I've given this a lot of thought Jerry. All that frustration. Ill never get any work done. So Im doing a complete 360. Im going for total efficiency and ability.",GEORGE,95,6
3,Whatever.,GEORGE,95,6
4,"(looking over her resume) Well Miss Coggins you're ah, obviously qualified for the job. You've all the necessary skills and experience. But you're extremely attractive. you're gorgeous. Im looking at you, I can't even remember my name. So ah, Im afraid this is not going to work out (he crumples her resume into a ball) Thanks for coming in.",GEORGE,95,6
5,You're luscious. You're ravishing. I would give up red meat just to get a glimpse of you in a bra. Im terribly sorry. (both George and the attractive female applicant stand up as George reaches across the desk and shakes her hand for coming in),GEORGE,95,6
6,I can't imagine.,GEORGE,95,6
7,Hey hey.,GEORGE,95,6
8,"Hey Elaine. (George hangs up his raincoat next to the door) Im telling you Jerry, having a secretary is incredible. (George claps hands) I don't know why I didnt have one before.",GEORGE,95,6
9,"Perhaps. (hehe) I walk in, everything is organized -- messages, appointments. And I can't tell you how proud I am of myself for going with Ade.",GEORGE,95,6
10,You arms look like something hanging in a kosher deli.,GEORGE,95,6
11,Well whad you buy it for?,GEORGE,95,6
12,"Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"")? I thought it was Demi?",GEORGE,95,6
13,"Really? I never heard of a semi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") tractor-trailer. (Jerry nods in agreement)",GEORGE,95,6
14,"(to Jerry, as Jerry nods in agreement) You know I think she might have something there.",GEORGE,95,6
15,"And then assuming the strike is resolved, on April 14th, we, ah, play the Angels. So lets clear a floor at the Anaheim Hotel.",GEORGE,95,6
16,"Ade, you're a wonder. (he he -- george laughs)",GEORGE,95,6
17,"Ade, I have to tell you, I, I have never met anybody so ... efficient.",GEORGE,95,6
18,"I mean you're just, you're just a marvel of organization.",GEORGE,95,6
19,"It's like Im thinking of something, and you're (snaps fingers) one step ahead of me.",GEORGE,95,6
20,"(coyly, he looks down and runs his finger along the top of the chair back in front of him) Do you, uh ... do you know what Im ... thinking about now?",GEORGE,95,6
21,"Is it, uh, doable?",GEORGE,95,6
22,Ade you are incredible,GEORGE,95,6
23,"What? Oh, My God!",GEORGE,95,6
24,"Ade, ahh, ahh, ah ... Im giving you a raise!",GEORGE,95,6
25,Yeah.,GEORGE,95,6
26,"Not that Im aware of, no.",GEORGE,95,6
27,I didnt think ahead.,GEORGE,95,6
28,I didnt say any other bawdy things.,GEORGE,95,6
29,"All right, you know you're not any help at all here. I don't know what even the point is of talking to you anymore.",GEORGE,95,6
30,"Yeah, well, I guess the only thing I can do is go into George Steinbrenners office and tell him he has to give her a raise.",GEORGE,95,6
31,3 days.,GEORGE,95,6
32,What?,GEORGE,95,6
33,"(Opens the door, looks in and then knocks 5 times) Mr. Steinbrenner, (waves) can I talk to you for a second?",GEORGE,95,6
34,"Well, you know, to be honest sir -- my, my new secretary Ade, came up with that one.",GEORGE,95,6
35,She supports her whole family. (walking slowly into the room),GEORGE,95,6
36,"Yes, In fact, her mother is in the hospital right now. It's some kind of a Diverticulitis. (he continues walking slowly towards Steinbrenners desk)",GEORGE,95,6
37,She cant even afford to go out to lunch. She's been eating in a high school cafeterias She pretends to be a teacher. It's pathetic.,GEORGE,95,6
38,You know what I was just thinking -- she could really use a raise.,GEORGE,95,6
39,"Yes, well, I sat down with Mr. Steinbrenner. I told him you have been doing great work. I said that you deserved a raise, and if you didnt get it, that I, was leaving. (motions with both arms in a circular motion to his right)",GEORGE,95,6
40,"Oh, well, don't worry about it -- he's got plenty of money. (spins his chair away from her)",GEORGE,95,6
41,"(spins his chair back to face her) So you got a $25,000 a year raise.",GEORGE,95,6
42,You're making more than I am.,GEORGE,95,6
43,What are you doing? You're making more than I am. A secretary cannot make more than her boss.,GEORGE,95,6
44,"But Mr. Steinbrenner, how can I be expected to perform my job properly, knowing that my uh, subordinate is making more money than I am? With all due respect sir, it's outta whack.",GEORGE,95,6
0,"Ok, So Barneys is having this huge sale. I try this dress on -- (holds the garment bag out towards Jerry) -- Stunning. Stunning. I couldn't take my eyes off myself.",ELAINE,95,6
1,"OK, so then I put it on at home. It looks like Im carrying twins.",ELAINE,95,6
2,Yeah exactly. Anyway I've got to go over there and return it.,ELAINE,95,6
3,All right Ill try it on again. You tell me what you think. (she turns and goes into the bedroom to change clothes),ELAINE,95,6
4,Hey George,ELAINE,95,6
5,All Right! (throws arms down) You answered it right there.,ELAINE,95,6
6,"I said, All Right.",ELAINE,95,6
7,"Why did I buy it, because in the mirror, at Barneys, I looked fabulous. This woman was just walking by said I looked like Demi (the ""i"" sounds like an ""e"") Moore in Indecent Proposal.",ELAINE,95,6
8,"Wait a minute (claps hands) Wait a minute. I know what's going on here. Skinny Mirrors! (she pushes George and Jerry in their respective chests, with her arms extended -- one arm for each of them -- they recoil with surprise)",ELAINE,95,6
9,"Skinny Mirrors! Barneys has Skinny Mirrors, they make you look, like, 10 pounds lighter.",ELAINE,95,6
10,Am I? (hands on hips) Do you think I would have bought this dress if I looked like this at Barneys?,ELAINE,95,6
11,Oh Im returning this dress to Barneys.,ELAINE,95,6
12,"Yeah yeah, ok.",ELAINE,95,6
13,Moisturizer? That's girls stuff.,ELAINE,95,6

17,How'd you manage that.,ELAINE,95,6
18,Where?,ELAINE,95,6
19,What would he be doing wearing your jacket?,ELAINE,95,6
20,Are you sure?,ELAINE,95,6
21,You are amazing.,ELAINE,95,6
22,"These mirrors are skinny mirrors. This is false ... reflecting. And I think, that the department of ... you know, whatever, would be very interested to know what's going on here.",ELAINE,95,6
23,OK fine. (smiling) I did like that little Calvin Klein number right by the elevator. You know the little ... (motions in the direction of the elevator),ELAINE,95,6
24,Ok thanks so much. (the Barneys sales associate turns and walks away. Elaine turns to Kramer as he admires himself in the mirror) What are you all dressed up for?,ELAINE,95,6
25,I like your little bag.,ELAINE,95,6
26,Huh.,ELAINE,95,6
27,"Kramer, what are you doing here?",ELAINE,95,6
28,What?,ELAINE,95,6
29,So go buy a new one.,ELAINE,95,6
30,So.,ELAINE,95,6
31,Ouhhh (Kramer disappears back behind his wall as Elaine opens the dressing room door),ELAINE,95,6
32,"Yeah it looks good here, but what does that mean?",ELAINE,95,6
33,"I don't know, I have to think about it. (the sales associate walks away) I need a nonpartisan mirror.",ELAINE,95,6
34,"Oh, this is insanity. Im not this hippie. (meaning her hips are not that large)",ELAINE,95,6
35,"Hey, what do you think of this?",ELAINE,95,6
36,This isn't going to work for me ... so if you could show me something else.,ELAINE,95,6
37,No?,ELAINE,95,6
38,I am?,ELAINE,95,6
39,Ha! That's preposterous.,ELAINE,95,6
40,"No. You can wrap it. (Dejected. Elaine puts her head down and her hand to her forehead as she walks into the dressing room area) Kramer, are you still in there?",ELAINE,95,6
41,Jerry?,ELAINE,95,6
42,"Donna, do you think you can get the salt stain out of this?",ELAINE,95,6
43,"(Tilts her head down, looking over her glasses in amazement of",ELAINE,95,6
0,Whoa. What are you all dressed up for?,KRAMER,95,6
1,Good idea.,KRAMER,95,6
2,"Hey look, if you're going there, maybe you could pick me up some of this super hydrating, it's a total-protection moisturizer with Uva.",KRAMER,95,6
3,"No no, look. Ill tell you what -- they're having a sale right.",KRAMER,95,6
4,"Ill meetcha down there, well have lunch.",KRAMER,95,6
5,"Well, well get to know each other. We never get to spend any time together. Oh sure we have our little group here, but ...

6,You got a pen?,KRAMER,95,6
7,And I need something to write on.,KRAMER,95,6
8,"I gust met Uma Therman. She's giving me her telephone number. Uma Jerry, Uma.",KRAMER,95,6
9,Yeah.,KRAMER,95,6

31,"Yeah, I just sold my suit to Bania for a cool three-hundred.",KRAMER,95,6
32,"What, at this place? It would destroy my whole profit margin.",KRAMER,95,6
33,"Listen do me a favor -- just call Jerry, tell him to bring me some clothes.",KRAMER,95,6
34,[Yeah] (through the door),KRAMER,95,6
35,"Oh, Jerry, you got my clothes?",KRAMER,95,6
36,Didnt Elaine call you?,KRAMER,95,6
37,Well what are you doing here?,KRAMER,95,6
38,"Oh, the stub, yeah. I left it in my, my pants",KRAMER,95,6
39,"Well, I sold them to Bania.",KRAMER,95,6
40,ouhhh -- I had Uma Thermans number written on that stub. I lost Umas number.,KRAMER,95,6
41,I told you I sold them to Bania.,KRAMER,95,6
42,Yeah.,KRAMER,95,6
43,"Well, I didnt think ahead.",KRAMER,95,6
44,Bania?,KRAMER,95,6
45,"Well you're not getting any money back. (Kramer opens the door) Jerry, come back in here.",KRAMER,95,6
46,Umas number is on that ticket.,KRAMER,95,6
47,Im not going to give him $300 now for a suit with moisturizer cream all over it.,KRAMER,95,6
48,What?,KRAMER,95,6
49,"(closes the door) All right, nice work. (he looks at the ticket, flips it over, and then over again) Where's Umas number? The moisturizer smudged out the phone number.",KRAMER,95,6
50,(grabs the ticket back and holds it up to the light) It must have been the botanical extracts.,KRAMER,95,6
0,Ready to go Lois?,JERRY,96,6
1,Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.,JERRY,96,6
2,Duncan Meyers!,JERRY,96,6
3,"Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.",JERRY,96,6
4,Hi oh.,JERRY,96,6
5,She couldn't make it.,JERRY,96,6
6,"I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.",JERRY,96,6
7,"Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see who was going to represent the school in this track meet.",JERRY,96,6
8,"I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym . . .",JERRY,96,6
9,"Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.",JERRY,96,6
10,"He was down at the other end. So he yells out, ""Ready, On your mark, Get set, "" and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.",JERRY,96,6
11,By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody had noticed the head start.,JERRY,96,6
12,And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my speed. Only Duncan suspected something was a miss. He's hated me ever since. Now he's back.,JERRY,96,6
13,I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose not to run.,JERRY,96,6
14,He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man that's some tart cider!,JERRY,96,6
15,Hi.,JERRY,96,6
16,"Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?",JERRY,96,6
17,He say anything?,JERRY,96,6
18,"Oh, nothing in particular.",JERRY,96,6
19,I did not cheat.,JERRY,96,6
20,"Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.",JERRY,96,6
21,Yes,JERRY,96,6
22,Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.,JERRY,96,6
23,I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got that,JERRY,96,6
24,"Wow, a communist. That's something.",JERRY,96,6
25,The Daily Worker has personal ads?,JERRY,96,6
26,Yours or hers?,JERRY,96,6
27,"Wow, look at you. So you got the job.",JERRY,96,6
28,"Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay, bye.",JERRY,96,6
29,Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow. He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she believes me.,JERRY,96,6
30,That's not bad.,JERRY,96,6
31,"I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the race?",JERRY,96,6
32,"Well, I . . . [sees George]",JERRY,96,6
33,"I'm sorry, uh,",JERRY,96,6
34,"Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.",JERRY,96,6
35,This is Lois.,JERRY,96,6
36,I'm I'm a comedian.,JERRY,96,6
37,"Yeah, yeah",JERRY,96,6
38,"Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?",JERRY,96,6
39,You really used to have a think full head of hair.,JERRY,96,6
40,"yeah, yeah.",JERRY,96,6
41,Well you've really built yourself up into something.,JERRY,96,6
42,"Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy little coffee shop like this.",JERRY,96,6
43,"Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that canvas?",JERRY,96,6
44,"George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.",JERRY,96,6
45,I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and I were just taking about the big race.,JERRY,96,6
46,Yeah.,JERRY,96,6
47,George!,JERRY,96,6
48,Did I get a head start?,JERRY,96,6
49,You satisfied? So you see?,JERRY,96,6
50,"No, no, no, another race - out of the question.",JERRY,96,6
51,All right! I'll do it. The race is on.,JERRY,96,6
52,And he's calling all these people from High School to come and watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding out there's no Santa Claus,JERRY,96,6
53,So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist. You just called the woman for a date.,JERRY,96,6
54,"Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? That is not going to work. . . . Why? I'll tell you why. Because I chose not to run!",JERRY,96,6
55,Hi how are you?,JERRY,96,6
56,What's the matter?,JERRY,96,6
57,What? He can't do that.,JERRY,96,6
58,Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.,JERRY,96,6
59,I need a miracle.,JERRY,96,6
60,"Yes, Mr. Beviacqua",JERRY,96,6
61,DUNCAN & JERRY: Yes Mr. Bevilacqua.,JERRY,96,6
62,"Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.",JERRY,96,6
0,Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?,GEORGE,96,6
1,Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A communist?,GEORGE,96,6
2,"Maybe he's just ""very well RED""?",GEORGE,96,6
3,"Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?",GEORGE,96,6
4,"Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. ""Exciting uninhibited woman seeks forward thinking comrade and appearance not important."" . . . Appearance Not Important! This is unbelievable. Finally this is an ideology I can embrace.",GEORGE,96,6
5,LAINE & GEORGE: Hey.,GEORGE,96,6
6,I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named Lois.,GEORGE,96,6
7,Duncan Meyers?,GEORGE,96,6
8,I looked up. I couldn't believe it.,GEORGE,96,6
9,So you lied to her?,GEORGE,96,6
10,"Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal ads in The Daily Worker?",GEORGE,96,6
11,And they say appearance is not important.,GEORGE,96,6
12,What's up?,GEORGE,96,6
13,He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School. I'll back up the story.,GEORGE,96,6
14,Not bad? It's gorgeous!,GEORGE,96,6
15,Natalie?,GEORGE,96,6
16,Thank you.,GEORGE,96,6
17,"Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten system.",GEORGE,96,6
18,"Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!",GEORGE,96,6
19,"George, George Costanza!",GEORGE,96,6
20,Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.,GEORGE,96,6
21,"Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me. It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't seen you guys in what, twenty years?",GEORGE,96,6
22,So what have you been doing with yourself?,GEORGE,96,6
23,"Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that ""did you ever notice?"" this kind of stuff.",GEORGE,96,6
24,It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.,GEORGE,96,6
25,"Yeah, yeah.",GEORGE,96,6
26,"Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what they say. The first million is the hardest one.",GEORGE,96,6
27,I'm an architect.,GEORGE,96,6
28,Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?,GEORGE,96,6

37,"Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .",GEORGE,96,6
38,"But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.",GEORGE,96,6
39,"Head start, oh no absolutely not.",GEORGE,96,6

2,"Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.",JERRY,97,6
3,He's fantastic.,JERRY,97,6
4,You loaned her Pitt's racquet?,JERRY,97,6
5,"Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump over the net.",JERRY,97,6
6,Bye bye,JERRY,97,6
7,"Hm, really?",JERRY,97,6
8,"Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to me. I missed the sport jacket.",JERRY,97,6
9,Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't fit him that well. To me there's just something about a monster in a blazer. It shows at least he's making an effort.,JERRY,97,6
10,I'm glad you enjoyed it.,JERRY,97,6
11,It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing off her like superman.,JERRY,97,6
12,"And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh. She says, ""That's funny."" ... That's funny!",JERRY,97,6
13,I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's like ... well it's like something!,JERRY,97,6
14,What noise?,JERRY,97,6
15,What blah?,JERRY,97,6
16,"Oh, you think she was refunding?",JERRY,97,6
17,In a manner of speaking.,JERRY,97,6
18,Thanks.,JERRY,97,6
19,A matron?,JERRY,97,6
20,"uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).",JERRY,97,6
21,Kramer you're going to have to face her some time,JERRY,97,6
22,Why didn't you just ask her for it?,JERRY,97,6
23,Yeah,JERRY,97,6
24,C'mon up.,JERRY,97,6
25,So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?,JERRY,97,6
26,He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?,JERRY,97,6
27,"Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch hour and just take it?",JERRY,97,6
28,Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!,JERRY,97,6
29,LAINE: JERRY: Hey,JERRY,97,6
30,So what happened with Kramer's mother?,JERRY,97,6
31,What's she like?,JERRY,97,6
32,What is it?,JERRY,97,6
33,We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What is it?,JERRY,97,6
34,LAINE: JERRY: Cosmo?,JERRY,97,6
35,LAINE: JERRY: Cosmo,JERRY,97,6
36,"Hi, is Sandy here?",JERRY,97,6
37,I would except I forgot to bring a towel.,JERRY,97,6
38,So the roommate laughed at everything I said.,JERRY,97,6
39,"It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none of those big coarse ""ha's."" You know those?",JERRY,97,6
40,Yeah.,JERRY,97,6
41,And the worst part of course is that she also possessed many of the other qualities prized by the Superficial Man.,JERRY,97,6
42,"So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.",JERRY,97,6
43,"Can't be done, huh?",JERRY,97,6
44,"""The Switch.""",JERRY,97,6
45,I wonder.,JERRY,97,6
46,They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.,JERRY,97,6
47,"The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it with or without you. So if you're scared, if you haven't got the stomach for this, let's get it out right now! And I'll go on my own. If not, you can get on board and we can get to work! Now what's it going to be?",JERRY,97,6
48,I couldn't do it without you.,JERRY,97,6
49,"Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible! It's true! You can't do the Switch! Nobody can do the Switch! It was a stupid idea to begin with! Let's face it. I'm stuck with the non-laugher and that's that!",JERRY,97,6
50,"Yeah, sure we will.",JERRY,97,6
51,All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a ménage à trois with her and her roommate.,JERRY,97,6
52,"And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged effect. Firstly, the very mention of the idea will cause Sandy to recoil in disgust, whereupon she will insist that I remove myself from the premises.",JERRY,97,6
53,"At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the roommate to apprise her of this abhorrent turn of events.",JERRY,97,6
54,The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy even as part of her cannot help but feel somewhat flattered by her inclusion in the unusual request.,JERRY,97,6
55,"Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw in it: They're roommates. She'd have to go out with me behind Sandy's back. She's not gonna do that.",JERRY,97,6
56,It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.,JERRY,97,6
57,"You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe its Manage A Trois.",JERRY,97,6
58,Uh?,JERRY,97,6
59,Hey,JERRY,97,6
60,"Ah, that's a shame.",JERRY,97,6
61,"Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.",JERRY,97,6
62,"No actually, she took it pretty well.",JERRY,97,6
63,She's into it.,JERRY,97,6
64,The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said she talked to the roommate and the roomate's into the manage too.,JERRY,97,6
65,"Oh, it's a scene man.",JERRY,97,6
66,What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.,JERRY,97,6
67,I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.,JERRY,97,6
68,"Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes everything. I'd have to dress different. I'd have to act different. I'd have to grow a mustache and get all kinds of robes and lotions and I'd need a new bedspread and new curtains I'd have to get thick carpeting and weirso lighting. I'd have to get new friends. I'd have to get orgy friends. ... Naw, I'm not ready for it.",JERRY,97,6
69,"Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.",JERRY,97,6
70,"Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?",JERRY,97,6
71,What do you mean you got caught?,JERRY,97,6
72,I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for taking your own racquet.,JERRY,97,6
73,Hi Cosmo.,JERRY,97,6
74,"Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?",JERRY,97,6
75,"Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?",JERRY,97,6
76,Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.,JERRY,97,6
0,Check that out (showing newspaper),GEORGE,97,6
1,That's right.,GEORGE,97,6
2,What's that.,GEORGE,97,6

38,"Alright, I gotta go.  I'm heading over to Bonnie's.",GEORGE,98,6
39,I gotta try and find a way to switch places with him.  It's like a Sigfried and Roy trick.,GEORGE,98,6
40,What a movie.  Good choice.,GEORGE,98,6
41,"Oh, Scott, Scott.  He's really great, isn't he?",GEORGE,98,6
42,"Yes he is.  Let me ask you something.  When you come out of the shower and you put your robe on, do you cinch it real tight, are you concerned about that?",GEORGE,98,6
43,"Do you hold the neck together with one hand, or are you just letting it flap in the breeze?",GEORGE,98,6
44,What's the massage situation?,GEORGE,98,6
45,"Is there any work being done?  Is there any rubbing, touching, finger manipulation on the other person, and if so, who's making the request?",GEORGE,98,6
46,"Say you go to the bathroom at two o'clock in the morning, what's the outfit?  I mean, you dressing up or is it come as you are?",GEORGE,98,6
47,"I'll tell you what's wrong, a grown woman with a male roommate!  It's unnatural, it's an abomination!",GEORGE,98,6
48,Hey!,GEORGE,98,6
49,I'm good.,GEORGE,98,6
50,How does Tim Whatley even know Newman?,GEORGE,98,6
51,Who goes to the Super Bowl with their mailman?!,GEORGE,98,6
52,"Well, he's merry.",GEORGE,98,6

54,And there's you ticket.,GEORGE,98,6
55,"Well, what happened when you got upstairs?",GEORGE,98,6
56,"They don't need any water, so you don't have to keep taking them to the bathroom.",GEORGE,98,6
57,Oh.  Oh!,GEORGE,98,6
58,That's right.  It's just me and her.,GEORGE,98,6
59,"I guess she did.  He's gone, now I'm the man.",GEORGE,98,6
60,"No, it's not.",GEORGE,98,6
61,Oh my god.,GEORGE,98,6
62,"I had the perfect situation here, he was shouldering half the load.",GEORGE,98,6
63,(walking towards the door)  I couldn't leave well enough alone?!,GEORGE,98,6
64,I gotta go help her tape up all his boxes and get them ready for shipping.,GEORGE,98,6
65,Thanks.,GEORGE,98,6
66,"What, what happened?  Where's, where's all the stuff?",GEORGE,98,6
67,"The table, the stereo, the VCR, the velvet couch, where's the velvet?",GEORGE,98,6
68,"Here's the TV.  I know you wanted to watch the Super Bowl.  Do you at least have some towels we could sit on?  It's, like, a four hour game.",GEORGE,98,6
69,"(internally)  How am I gonna get out of this?  Think Costanza, think!",GEORGE,98,6
70,"Hey, do you know, Bonnie, I just had a pretty wild idea.",GEORGE,98,6
71,"Well I, uh, I'm not sure how you pronounce it or anything, but I, uh, I believe it's Ménage à Trois?",GEORGE,98,6
0,Hey.,ELAINE,98,6
1,"Hey.  Oh, is that a label maker?",ELAINE,98,6
2,"Love the Label Baby, baby.  You know those things make great gifts, I just got one of those for Tim Whatley for Christmas.",ELAINE,98,6
3,Yeah.  Who sent you that one?,ELAINE,98,6
4,"Not, my Tim Whatley?",ELAINE,98,6
5,I think this is the same one I gave him.  He recycled this gift.  He's a regifter!,ELAINE,98,6
6,"Yeah, perhaps.",ELAINE,98,6
7,"Um, he said, ""Oh.  A label maker.  Howbout that?""",ELAINE,98,6
8,"Yeah, so?",ELAINE,98,6
9,What do you mean?,ELAINE,98,6
10,"I don't know, I guess I'll just get invited up to his apartment and see if he's got a label maker.",ELAINE,98,6
11,"Oh, he did some dental work for me and he didn't charge me so I thought I'd get him a Christmas present.",ELAINE,98,6
12,Yes it is.,ELAINE,98,6
13,Yeah.,ELAINE,98,6
14,Aren't you gonna invite me upstairs?,ELAINE,98,6

16,We'll see.,ELAINE,98,6
17,"Hey, guess what?  I'm going to the Super Bowl with Tim Whatley.",ELAINE,98,6
18,We went out for coffee last night and he offered me a ticket.,ELAINE,98,6
19,"Ah, well.",ELAINE,98,6
20,"It was totally out of the blue.  We went upstairs to his apartment, you know, to look for the label maker.",ELAINE,98,6
21,No.,ELAINE,98,6
22,"I said, ""Do you wanna go upstairs?""",ELAINE,98,6
23,What?,ELAINE,98,6
24,Why?,ELAINE,98,6
25,"You mean just because I asked him to go upstairs, he thinks he's going downtown?",ELAINE,98,6
26,You're crazy.,ELAINE,98,6
27,"As soon as we walked in, he got a call from one of his patients with an impacted molar or something so he had to leave.  I didn't even get a chance to look for the label maker.",ELAINE,98,6
28,I've got a confession to make.,ELAINE,98,6
29,I've got Super Bowl fever.,ELAINE,98,6
30,So where are we staying?,ELAINE,98,6
31,Oh.  Big room?,ELAINE,98,6
32,Downtown?,ELAINE,98,6
33,"What do they have there, a couple of beds?",ELAINE,98,6
34,"No, but don't you think there should be two beds?  There's two of us.",ELAINE,98,6
35,"Hello, Tim.",ELAINE,98,6
36,"Don't worry, Tim.  I didn't come by to yell at you, I didn't come by for that at all.  I just came by to pick up my label maker.  I gave you a label maker and now I would like to have it back.",ELAINE,98,6
37,"But you gave me a ticket to the Super Bowl.  Hand it over, Whatley.",ELAINE,98,6
38,"You don't have the label maker, do you?",ELAINE,98,6
39,I knew it!  You're a regifter!,ELAINE,98,6
40,What?,ELAINE,98,6
41,"(visibly upset)  Well, I bought it for you because you were so nice to me for not charging me for the dental work.  The way you worked on my filling, you were so, so gentle and so caring and so sensitive.",ELAINE,98,6
0,Where can I put this?,KRAMER,98,6
1,"It's Risk, Jerry.  The game of world conquest. (brushing newspapers off the table with his foot and setting the game board down)  Alright, that's perfect.",KRAMER,98,6
2,"The board, Jerry.  We've been playing at Newman's for six hours but he's gotta go.",KRAMER,98,6
3,We have to put the board in a neutral place where no one will tamper with it.,KRAMER,98,6
4,"Yes, yes.  You're like Switzerland.",KRAMER,98,6
5,"Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in a epic struggle for world domination.  It's winner take all.  People cannot be trusted.",KRAMER,98,6

10,(entering)  Hey.,KRAMER,98,6
11,Guess what?  I saw Newman talking to the super.,KRAMER,98,6
12,The super has keys to your apartment.  Don't you see what's going on? Newman is planning a sneak attack.,KRAMER,98,6
13,"Yeah, alright, fine.  You sit there and you watch while Newman takes over the world.  But he'd be a horrible leader.  And you know who's gonna suffer?  The little people; you and George.",KRAMER,98,6
14,"Oh.  I talked to Arthur Jobanian.  Yeah, the Drake's wedding?  That's off.",KRAMER,98,6
15,"The Drake, he found out that the wedding is on the same day as the Super Bowl.  So he wanted to postpone it, they got in a big argument and *phlf* it's over.",KRAMER,98,6
16,Hey.,KRAMER,98,6
17,I'm watching your door.,KRAMER,98,6
18,"Yeah, from my peephole.  Fisheye, sees all.",KRAMER,98,6
19,Newman!,KRAMER,98,6
20,I'm taking the Congo as a penalty!,KRAMER,98,6
21,(rolling the dice) Yeah.  I am taking over South America and there ain't nothing you can do about it.,KRAMER,98,6
22,(running to the window)  What?!  Not my car!!  Hey!!  They're towing my car!!,KRAMER,98,6
23,I'm taking the board with me.,KRAMER,98,6
24,"Oh, stop stalling.  Come on.",KRAMER,98,6
25,Or is it because I've built a stronghold around Greenland?  I've driven you out of Western Europe and I've left you teetering on the brink of complete annihilation.,KRAMER,98,6
26,"Ha ha, the Ukraine.  Do you know what the Ukraine is?  It's a sitting duck.  A road apple, Newman.  The Ukraine is weak.  It's feeble.  I think it's time to put the hurt on the Ukraine.",KRAMER,98,6
27,"Yeah, well we're playing a game here, pal.",KRAMER,98,6
0,So you called the cop a pig?,JERRY,99,6

8,He swore me to secrecy.,JERRY,99,6
9,It's not like you're my wife.,JERRY,99,6
10,"Hey, believe me, you were better off not knowing. It's not easy to deal with someone in a situation like this. I was so nice to him I almost made myself sick.",JERRY,99,6
11,"That's right, you let him have it.",JERRY,99,6
12,Who is he not to tell you about his life-threatening illness?,JERRY,99,6
13,His illness is your business.,JERRY,99,6

33,So what was wrong with him?,JERRY,99,6
34,So he's been lying to me for two months?!,JERRY,99,6
35,"What kind of person is this? There's only one other person who might be able to do something like this, and that's you.",JERRY,99,6
36,I don't even think you could do it.,JERRY,99,6
37,"Yeah, I guess you could.",JERRY,99,6
38,"Did you know he was so worried about losing more hair if he had to get chemo treatment, I bought him an unlimited gift certificate at the Hair Team For Men, just to put his mind at ease?",JERRY,99,6
39,"Yeah. Oh, I can't wait to talk to this guy. (moves to pick up phone)",JERRY,99,6

55,"The Whip. In the Senate, in the House.",JERRY,99,6
56,Can you believe someone would lie about chemotherapy to get a wig? Would you do that?,JERRY,99,6
57,Yeah.,JERRY,99,6
58,And you know what else? He picked up that woman in the coffee shop.,JERRY,99,6
59,Yeah!,JERRY,99,6
60,Because he was brimming with confidence from the toupee.,JERRY,99,6
61,"She thinks a guy who lies about a life-threatening illness, so he can get some phony hair has perspective?",JERRY,99,6
62,Walked right over to her table.,JERRY,99,6
63,"You ever see what that thing looks like in the back? You got your natural little curls on the bottom, and then that big phony mat coming down on top of 'em.",JERRY,99,6
64,What if you get involved with a woman? How're you gonna tell her?,JERRY,99,6
65,"So you keep it a secret your whole life, then at your funeral the mortician comes out (as mortician) 'Here, Mrs Costanza, I thought you might want this'. (as Mrs Costanza, horrified) Aahh!",JERRY,99,6
66,"(unimpressed) I, really can't say.",JERRY,99,6

11,"So, is he okay?",GEORGE,99,6
12,"Huh, really? How bad? Was he on his death bed?",GEORGE,99,6
13,So why didn't you tell me?,GEORGE,99,6
14,So?,GEORGE,99,6

16,"Well, I wanna talk to him about this.",GEORGE,99,6
17,Mmm-mm.,GEORGE,99,6

19,"If not mine, whose?",GEORGE,99,6
20,"No, an old friend of ours, Gary.",GEORGE,99,6
21,"(to Jerry, yelling) You told her? She's not your wife!",GEORGE,99,6
22,You don't think I can keep a secret?,GEORGE,99,6
23,You don't trust my poker face?,GEORGE,99,6
24,(shamefaced) No.,GEORGE,99,6
25,"I have to say, as a glasses wearer I take exception to that. That's like me buying a wheelchair to cruise around in.",GEORGE,99,6
26,"Eh, there's that woman that never talks to anybody.",GEORGE,99,6
27,"Every day she comes in, she sits at that table and reads. Never talks to anybody.",GEORGE,99,6
28,"(pleasant surprise) Really? (admonishing) You know Gary, I really have to say, I'm a little bit hurt that you didn't decide to confide in me.",GEORGE,99,6
29,Well I still think it was wrong.,GEORGE,99,6
30,"(well, obviously) Yes.",GEORGE,99,6
31,"(standing) All right, I'm gonna move my car, my meter's up. Can't park in this city.",GEORGE,99,6

37,Just one? I'm living like twenty. (chuckles) What's yours?,GEORGE,99,6
38,"(shifty, avoiding Jerry's eyes) Fine, fine. (he removes his coat)",GEORGE,99,6
39,(shifty) Yeah.,GEORGE,99,6
40,No. Nothing. Fine. (he sits at the table),GEORGE,99,6
41,My regular face.,GEORGE,99,6

55,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can't say anything. (rushes to take phone from Jerry)",GEORGE,99,6
56,"(puts down handset) Because he'll know I told you. Besides, he's giving me a parking spot around the corner for practically nothing.",GEORGE,99,6
57,Yeah.,GEORGE,99,6
58,"Yeah, well you have to maintain the same disposition too. You can't start acting any differently. You have to be nice.",GEORGE,99,6
59,Because you were being so nice.,GEORGE,99,6

63,You didn't?,GEORGE,99,6
64,Regards?,GEORGE,99,6
65,"So, you didn't think this was a date?",GEORGE,99,6
66,I thought it was a date.,GEORGE,99,6
67,What about the regards?,GEORGE,99,6
68,"No, tell me.",GEORGE,99,6
69,Me? Oh yeah.,GEORGE,99,6
70,"Oh, the guy's got some perspective there.",GEORGE,99,6
71,"(frustrated) Oh, look at this. There's no place to park around here. I don't even know why they sell cars in Manhattan.",GEORGE,99,6
72,Can you believe he sold his glasses on the street?,GEORGE,99,6
73,No. Definitely not.,GEORGE,99,6
74,I'm pretty sure I wouldn't.,GEORGE,99,6
75,The one who always sits by herself?,GEORGE,99,6
76,How did he do that?,GEORGE,99,6
77,Really? And Debby told me that she fell in love with him because he has all this perspective!,GEORGE,99,6
78,(opening door to leave) He picked her up?,GEORGE,99,6
79,"Wow. (he runs his fingers through his hair, and then brushes the resulting fallout off his jacket)",GEORGE,99,6
80,I'll try some on and see how they look. It's just hair.,GEORGE,99,6
81,"Well, some of 'em look good. The ones that look good you don't even know about.",GEORGE,99,6
82,"The way they make 'em these days, I'll never have to tell her.",GEORGE,99,6
83,"(to Jerry) Well, what d'you think?",GEORGE,99,6
84,"No, say. I want you to say.",GEORGE,99,6
85,(examining reflection) I really think this looks pretty good.,GEORGE,99,6
86,"(to salesman) Well, maybe you could show me something else.",GEORGE,99,6
87,(leaps to feet) Jerry!,GEORGE,99,6
88,Please. (sits again),GEORGE,99,6
89,"Well, I'm, I'm just looking.",GEORGE,99,6
90,What?,GEORGE,99,6
91,(admiring himself in mirror) I did.,GEORGE,99,6
92,How's your life? All right?,GEORGE,99,6
0,Were you just talking about me?,ELAINE,99,6
1,"Oh, the guy with cancer?",ELAINE,99,6
2,"Egh, Jake Jarmel?",ELAINE,99,6
3,Why? You don't wear glasses.,ELAINE,99,6
4,"Well, he's having a two day book signing at Waldens.",ELAINE,99,6
5,"You know, we had a really bad break-up.",ELAINE,99,6
6,"(upset) Yeah, the Jujy Fruits.",ELAINE,99,6
7,So he refused to tell you where he got the glasses?,ELAINE,99,6
8,"Yeah, isn't that just like him? (she steps over Jerry's legs) You know, he has to be the only one who has 'em.",ELAINE,99,6
9,What? (she slams the door shut before Kramer can exit) You told Jake I said hi?,ELAINE,99,6
10,I can't believe you did that! Why did you tell him I said hi? I never said hi! (to Jerry) When did I say hi?,ELAINE,99,6
11,"No, no. (stamps foot) Kramer, you don't understand. He made the last contact between us. I had the upper hand in the post-breakup relationship. If he thinks that I said hi, then I lose the upper hand.",ELAINE,99,6
12,Nowhere.,ELAINE,99,6
13,So what if I do? (heads for the door),ELAINE,99,6
14,"So you see, Kramer took it upon himself to say hi to you from me. When in fact it was an unauthorised hi.",ELAINE,99,6
15,That's what I'm saying.,ELAINE,99,6
16,Correct.,ELAINE,99,6
17,Correct.,ELAINE,99,6
18,Correct. (catches herself) What's that?,ELAINE,99,6
19,"(takes the book from the guy and signs it herself) How can you say that I still like you, when I didn't even say hi to you?",ELAINE,99,6
20,"Ah, Jake... (realises his logic) I, uh...",ELAINE,99,6
21,"Anyway, I admit I was dumb to go to the bookstore to tell him I didn't say hi, but he didn't have to act so smug. Oh, I hate smugness. Don't you hate smugness?",ELAINE,99,6
22,"(looking out of window) Oh my God. That man over there. I think he's wearing glasses that look just like Jake's. Pull over, stop the car. (hands money to cabbie as she exits) Here, here. I think I got a way of getting back at my ex-boyfriend.",ELAINE,99,6
23,"(calling down street) 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. (catches up to guy) Excuse me, sir. Sir?",ELAINE,99,6
24,"Uh. Ah, if you don't mind my asking, could you tell me where you got your glasses?",ELAINE,99,6
25,Malaysia?,ELAINE,99,6
26,"Uhm, look, I know this'll sound odd, but can I buy them from you?",ELAINE,99,6

11,"I know, I know. But I need a new look, I'm stagnating.",KRAMER,99,6
12,"Yeah, I've considered that. (to Elaine) Look, how do I get in touch with this guy?",KRAMER,99,6
13,Ah.,KRAMER,99,6
14,"Okay, thank you. Listen Jake, uh, where did you get those eyeglass frames?",KRAMER,99,6
15,So you don't know where you got 'em?,KRAMER,99,6
16,"Well, that's peculiar. (leaves)",KRAMER,99,6
17,"...so I called the litterbug a pig, not you. I like policeman. I wanted to be a policeman.",KRAMER,99,6

23,"Well, it's uh, common courtesy.",KRAMER,99,6
24,"(to the exiting Elaine) Yeah, well, listen. If you're going there, (following her out the door) maybe you can get him to tell you where he got those glasses. (shouting after her) Elaine!",KRAMER,99,6

31,What whip?,KRAMER,99,6
32,"Well, you know in the old days, when the senators didn't vote the way that the party leaders wanted 'em to... they whipped them. (holds imaginary whip) You better vote the way we want you to, or there's gonna be big trouble. (cracks invisible whip and makes sound effect)",KRAMER,99,6

36,"(interrupting) Ah, don't play dumb. It's me, Cosmo.",KRAMER,99,6
37,"You don't think I know how you're feeling, every second of the day? Looking over your shoulder to see if someone's coming up from behind. Sitting alone at night, knowing they could be closing in.",KRAMER,99,6
38,"Ga, of course you can't, you poor sap! Now why didn't you tell me?",KRAMER,99,6
39,So you been living this secret the whole time by yourself?,KRAMER,99,6

0,Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with the sticks.,JERRY,102,6
1,You stink. You know you stink. What is this?,JERRY,102,6
2,Oh. Your ballet tickets.,JERRY,102,6
3,"No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.",JERRY,102,6
4,A beard?,JERRY,102,6
5,Yes.,JERRY,102,6
6,Why are you doing this?,JERRY,102,6
7,Yeah.,JERRY,102,6
8,Well what about me?,JERRY,102,6
9,It sounds like an excellent idea.,JERRY,102,6
10,You can't go wrong with pouty.,JERRY,102,6
11,"Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?",JERRY,102,6
12,"Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law on my side.",JERRY,102,6
13,And did they suspect anything?,JERRY,102,6
14,And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend for homosexuals.,JERRY,102,6
15,You said that already.,JERRY,102,6
16,Yeah.,JERRY,102,6
17,Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?,JERRY,102,6
18,"Yeah, but?",JERRY,102,6
19,So?,JERRY,102,6
20,Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?,JERRY,102,6
21,You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not going to suddenly switch sides. Forget about it.,JERRY,102,6
22,Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes his team. He's set with that team.,JERRY,102,6
23,"Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.",JERRY,102,6
24,They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.,JERRY,102,6
25,Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's no possibility of sex.,JERRY,102,6
26,You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.,JERRY,102,6
27,Are you that desperate?,JERRY,102,6
28,"So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's settled. First date, no weapons... All right I'll see you then... Okay, bye.",JERRY,102,6
29,What are you looking for?,JERRY,102,6
30,Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.,JERRY,102,6
31,What about a plastic bag?,JERRY,102,6
32,What is the difference?,JERRY,102,6
33,So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?,JERRY,102,6
34,What did you say to her?,JERRY,102,6
35,I don't know.,JERRY,102,6
36,As you see it?,JERRY,102,6
37,"Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?",JERRY,102,6
38,"You know, you're little hair hat there.",JERRY,102,6
39,Don't you think she could tell?,JERRY,102,6
40,Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks away.,JERRY,102,6
41,Have you noticed people staring at your head?,JERRY,102,6
42,Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about it.,JERRY,102,6
43,"Oh, I'll split a cab with you.",JERRY,102,6
44,Hi Sarge.,JERRY,102,6
45,What's that?,JERRY,102,6
46,"Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that their pants are actually on fire?",JERRY,102,6
47,Really.,JERRY,102,6
48,No.,JERRY,102,6
49,I admit it. I don't watch it.,JERRY,102,6
50,The poly?,JERRY,102,6
51,Yes. Melrose Place.,JERRY,102,6
52,Well I do.,JERRY,102,6
53,Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.,JERRY,102,6
54,"And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed it.",JERRY,102,6
55,The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test and that needle's going to be going wild.,JERRY,102,6
56,It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing to.,JERRY,102,6
57,I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.,JERRY,102,6
58,"Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful, duplicitous, deceptive minds of our time. Who better to advise me?",JERRY,102,6
59,Did you shake it up?,JERRY,102,6
60,You gotta shake it up.,JERRY,102,6
61,"Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.",JERRY,102,6
62,So tonight are you going to make the move?,JERRY,102,6
63,Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?,JERRY,102,6
64,How so?,JERRY,102,6
65,She's bald?,JERRY,102,6
66,Women go bald?,JERRY,102,6
67,Hey.,JERRY,102,6
68,Good to have you back.,JERRY,102,6
69,She's as good as anybody else.,JERRY,102,6
70,Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like a bald-again.,JERRY,102,6
71,"So George, how do I beat this lie detector?",JERRY,102,6
72,"Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can help me.",JERRY,102,6
73,"All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe I'm doing this.",JERRY,102,6
74,What?,JERRY,102,6
75,Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?,JERRY,102,6
76,"Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to every woman who's ever said ""Too bad he's gay"".",JERRY,102,6
77,Jerry Seinfeld.,JERRY,102,6
78,129 West 81st street.,JERRY,102,6
79,I don't know.,JERRY,102,6
80,I don't know.,JERRY,102,6
81,I don't know.,JERRY,102,6
82,"(He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly, he slept with her sister. He tricked her into giving him half her business, and then she goes ahead and sleeps with him again. I mean she's crazy. How could she do something like that? Oh that Jane, she makes me so mad.",JERRY,102,6
83,He went back? What do you mean he went back?,JERRY,102,6
84,"I don't understand it. You were having such a great time, the sex, the shopping.",JERRY,102,6
85,You can't. That's why they lose very few players.,JERRY,102,6
86,"Well there's always a place for you, on our team.",JERRY,102,6
87,Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.,JERRY,102,6
88,Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.,JERRY,102,6
89,"All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.",JERRY,102,6
90,"Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.",JERRY,102,6
0,"Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh? Excuse me.",GEORGE,102,6
1,Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little* bit worried that you may have missed the boat?,GEORGE,102,6
2,"Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if you must. But let me tell you something, with my personality and this set of hair, you know what I am now? I am in the game. I no longer defer to the coifed. I'm a player.",GEORGE,102,6
3,So she's gorgeous.,GEORGE,102,6
4,Well have you got a picture?,GEORGE,102,6
5,"Well, I have to see her.",GEORGE,102,6
6,Really?,GEORGE,102,6
7,Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?,GEORGE,102,6
8,Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to see how those sketch artists do it.,GEORGE,102,6
9,Pouty? I like that.,GEORGE,102,6
10,I'm excited about the pouty.,GEORGE,102,6
11,"Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.",GEORGE,102,6
12,Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the police woman?,GEORGE,102,6
13,So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.,GEORGE,102,6
14,Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.,GEORGE,102,6
15,Why didn't anything happen between you two?,GEORGE,102,6
16,Yes I did.,GEORGE,102,6
17,What do you think I said?,GEORGE,102,6
18,I told her the truth.,GEORGE,102,6
19,"Yes, as I see it.",GEORGE,102,6
20,What hat?,GEORGE,102,6
21,No.,GEORGE,102,6
22,You only think that because you know me.,GEORGE,102,6
23,I noticed people staring at my head because they like what they see.,GEORGE,102,6
24,"Look, I guarantee she won't know.",GEORGE,102,6
25,"(thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the face, just like the picture.",GEORGE,102,6
26,Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.,GEORGE,102,6
27,"No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.",GEORGE,102,6
28,Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.,GEORGE,102,6
29,That's an interesting question.,GEORGE,102,6
30,How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!,GEORGE,102,6
31,What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.,GEORGE,102,6
32,She's bald.,GEORGE,102,6
33,Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there she was (waving his hand over his head) hello. It was like I was looking at myself in the mirror.,GEORGE,102,6
34,"Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor and says ""Give me the Larry Fine.""",GEORGE,102,6
35,You fixed me up with a bald woman.,GEORGE,102,6
36,"Yeah, that's right.",GEORGE,102,6
37,So?,GEORGE,102,6
38,No I'm not. I *was* bald.,GEORGE,102,6
39,Elaine.,GEORGE,102,6
40,"No, no, no Elaine.",GEORGE,102,6
41,Nooooo.,GEORGE,102,6
42,"I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window, it was the best thing that ever happened to me. I feel like my old self again. Totally inadequate, completely insecure, paranoid, neurotic, it's a pleasure.",GEORGE,102,6
43,And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to keep seeing the bald woman.,GEORGE,102,6
44,Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't a lot of hair on it.,GEORGE,102,6
45,Going to need a little more coffee here.,GEORGE,102,6
46,"I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.",GEORGE,102,6
47,"Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, ""Teach me to sing like you.""",GEORGE,102,6
48,"Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe it.",GEORGE,102,6
49,Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.,GEORGE,102,6
50,"I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me. Heh, you like that one? A woman with no prospects and no *hair*, told me that I wasn't her type. Apparently *baldy* likes a slimmer guy.",GEORGE,102,6
0,I know. I need a lesson.,ELAINE,102,6
1,Oh. My ballet tickets.,ELAINE,102,6
2,"Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?",ELAINE,102,6
3,"You know, I'm going as a beard.",ELAINE,102,6
4,"Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's, I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably gorgeous, of course he's gay.",ELAINE,102,6
5,"So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's afraid that his boss can't handle his orientation, so I'm going along as his date.",ELAINE,102,6
6,"Swan Lake, at the Met.",ELAINE,102,6
7,"Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?",ELAINE,102,6
8,Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?,ELAINE,102,6
9,"Oh, come on.",ELAINE,102,6
10,You look ridiculous in that thing.,ELAINE,102,6
11,Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your brain.,ELAINE,102,6
12,"Well by now, you think people would be a little more open minded.",ELAINE,102,6
13,Yes indeed.,ELAINE,102,6
14,Really. Why?,ELAINE,102,6
15,"Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if you know what I mean. No sirree Bob. Sure, I mean in a lot of ways, he's a typical guy, he likes his sports, but he counters that side with the side you see here tonight at the ballet, or the pleasure he gets in watching Ms. Liza Minelli belt out a few choice numbers. It's those two halves of his personality that just come together to make him the very special guy that he is.",ELAINE,102,6
16,"Oh, hi honey.",ELAINE,102,6
17,Oh it was such a great night.,ELAINE,102,6
18,"No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him honey.",ELAINE,102,6
19,Oh it was such a great night. Oh.,ELAINE,102,6
20,Oh I did?,ELAINE,102,6
21,Oh.,ELAINE,102,6
22,He's incredible.,ELAINE,102,6
23,"Yeah, I know.",ELAINE,102,6
24,What?,ELAINE,102,6
25,Well it did occur to me.,ELAINE,102,6
26,Why? Is it irrevocable?,ELAINE,102,6
27,We've got a good team.,ELAINE,102,6
28,Why can't he play for us?,ELAINE,102,6
29,We just got along *so* great.,ELAINE,102,6
30,"No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something. I perceived a possibility Jerry.",ELAINE,102,6
31,I realize that.,ELAINE,102,6
32,Yes I am.,ELAINE,102,6
33,Melrose Place?,ELAINE,102,6
34,I just didn't know you watched that.,ELAINE,102,6
35,I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or join in the conversation.,ELAINE,102,6
36,You mean this whole time we could have been discussing Sydney and Michael and Jane...,ELAINE,102,6
37,Why? Why were you so embarrassed?,ELAINE,102,6
38,That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?,ELAINE,102,6
39,So what are you going to do?,ELAINE,102,6
40,"Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?",ELAINE,102,6
41,Oh god this tastes terrible.,ELAINE,102,6
42,No.,ELAINE,102,6
43,No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.,ELAINE,102,6
44,"So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and his wife.",ELAINE,102,6
45,"Yeah, I think I might.",ELAINE,102,6
46,What do you mean bald?,ELAINE,102,6
47,Oh come on.,ELAINE,102,6
48,Well maybe she got a haircut or something.,ELAINE,102,6
49,"Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.",ELAINE,102,6
50,Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because they're bald.,ELAINE,102,6
51,(puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!,ELAINE,102,6
52,(shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm doing with it.,ELAINE,102,6
53,Well I figured that's what couples do.,ELAINE,102,6
54,Well it was easy. Really.,ELAINE,102,6
55,"Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?",ELAINE,102,6
56,Yeah. Upstairs?,ELAINE,102,6
57,"I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in... changing teams?",ELAINE,102,6
58,Have you ever thought about it?,ELAINE,102,6
59,"Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.",ELAINE,102,6
60,"Hey, I did it.",ELAINE,102,6
61,I turned him. He defected.,ELAINE,102,6
62,Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom- boom.,ELAINE,102,6
63,"Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible. Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot. The perfect man. Nothing but sex and shopping.",ELAINE,102,6
64,He went back.,ELAINE,102,6
65,"Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have access to the, uh... equipment, what, thirty, forty-five minutes a week. And that's on a good week. How can I be expected to have the same expertise as people who *own* this equipment, and have access to it twenty-four hours a day, their entire lives.",ELAINE,102,6
66,"Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.",ELAINE,102,6
67,Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?,ELAINE,102,6
68,Okay.,ELAINE,102,6
69,"Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire what you've done.",ELAINE,102,6
70,What is the matter?,ELAINE,102,6
71,"I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did, and it made him act like a jerk.",ELAINE,102,6
0,"Oh, Chinese food. I knew I smelled something.",KRAMER,102,6
1,I think he looks fantastic.,KRAMER,102,6
2,"No, I never realized what an attractive man he is.",KRAMER,102,6
3,"You know I just thought of something. I know this gorgeous woman, she called me up this morning, she's moving into the city, and she asked me if I know of anyone she could meet. Now you can go out with her.",KRAMER,102,6
4,No I think he's got you beat buddy.,KRAMER,102,6
5,"Oh yeah, last time I saw her she was, five years ago.",KRAMER,102,6
6,No.,KRAMER,102,6
7,"Hey, I know what we can do. I've got a friend who works over at the police station. He's a composite artist.",KRAMER,102,6
8,"Yeah, yeah, maybe I can get him to draw a picture of her for you.",KRAMER,102,6
9,"Yeah, yeah. I think he will.",KRAMER,102,6
10,"Hey Jerry, you want this, cause I'm going to give it to a homeless person.",KRAMER,102,6
11,Here you go brother. Some food for you.,KRAMER,102,6
12,Now are you going to be here in an hour?,KRAMER,102,6
13,"Oh that's good, that's good. Make the eyes, uh, what's that nut?",KRAMER,102,6
14,Almond. Yeah. Make the lips fuller. Poutier.,KRAMER,102,6
15,"All right George, come on, take a look.",KRAMER,102,6
16,"Hey, man. Enjoy the food?",KRAMER,102,6
17,"Oh, listen, I'll take that Tupperware now.",KRAMER,102,6
18,"Woah, woah, that's mine.",KRAMER,102,6
19,"No, no, I didn't say you could keep it. You see I don't give away tupperware.",KRAMER,102,6
20,I didn't think I had to. Look with a piece of Tupperware you just assume.,KRAMER,102,6
21,Tupperware.,KRAMER,102,6
22,"I knew this was going to happen. I just made a delicious casserole, but now it won't keep because I have no Tupperware.",KRAMER,102,6
23,You must be kidding.,KRAMER,102,6
24,"The patented burp, Jerry. It locks in freshness.",KRAMER,102,6
25,"Oh yeah, you talked to her.",KRAMER,102,6
26,Yeah well we go way back.,KRAMER,102,6
27,Who's to say it didn't?,KRAMER,102,6
28,"No, no, no she can't tell. It's a perfect match. Beautiful job.",KRAMER,102,6
29,"No he's not going to take it off. If he was going to go over there bald, I never would have introduced him.",KRAMER,102,6
30,"Yeah that's it. All right, I'm going to go down to the precinct. I'm going to have lunch with Lou.",KRAMER,102,6
31,Hey I'm really sorry about the other day. Really sorry.,KRAMER,102,6

33,Hey.,KRAMER,102,6
34,Bald?,KRAMER,102,6
35,Well I'll tell you what I think. I think she saw you with that piece off and was devastated. You blew it boy. You really blew it. And you had to ruin it for him. Didn't you?,KRAMER,102,6
36,"Hey, how you doing Stu? Eddie, my man. You again? Boy, you're a slippery one. You'd better straighten up and fly right buddy boy.",KRAMER,102,6
37,Me?,KRAMER,102,6

1,(scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.,JERRY,103,6
2,Yeah? Would you do it?,JERRY,103,6
3,"Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the dance of a very proud people.",JERRY,103,6
4,"Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright, okay. Don't worry about it. (listens) Okay, I'll see you later. Alright, bye.",JERRY,103,6
5,I have to go over to my grandmother's.,JERRY,103,6
6,I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.,JERRY,103,6
7,"No, we have time.",JERRY,103,6
8,"Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has Difficulty distinguishing between the past and the present.",JERRY,103,6
9,Like toothpaste?,JERRY,103,6
10,There's a squeeze ketchup.,JERRY,103,6
11,"Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason that they make squeeze ketchup?",JERRY,103,6
12,I really don't see the difference.,JERRY,103,6
13,It's subtle.,JERRY,103,6
14,"(looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.",JERRY,103,6
15,"Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.",JERRY,103,6
16,Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.,JERRY,103,6
17,"Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did it once, on her birthday, somehow it mushroomed. Now I dread seeing her because of it.",JERRY,103,6
18,"Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.",JERRY,103,6
19,"No, I told you I admire your hearing.",JERRY,103,6
20,"No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.",JERRY,103,6
21,Bye.,JERRY,103,6
22,"(adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my last kiss hello. I am getting off the kiss program with her.",JERRY,103,6
23,"Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I don't see the point to it. I'm not thrilled with all the handshaking either, but one step at a time.",JERRY,103,6
24,"(to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?",JERRY,103,6
25,She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You should say something to her.,JERRY,103,6
26,Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like that.,JERRY,103,6
27,"What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come out with it.",JERRY,103,6
28,Speak of the devil.,JERRY,103,6
29,What for?,JERRY,103,6
30,Why?,JERRY,103,6
31,"(reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the lobby.",JERRY,103,6
32,"(still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with everyone, every time I go in the building. I just wanna nod and be on my way.",JERRY,103,6
33,"Hello, uncle Leo!",JERRY,103,6
34,Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.,JERRY,103,6
35,Hi Nana.,JERRY,103,6

41,"Thanks, Julio.",JERRY,103,6
42,Huh?,JERRY,103,6
43,What's going on here?,JERRY,103,6
44,"(suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?",JERRY,103,6
45,What for?,JERRY,103,6
46,"(accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?",JERRY,103,6
47,"I told you, forget it.",JERRY,103,6
48,You're robbing me.,JERRY,103,6
49,(removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?,JERRY,103,6
50,"Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer says something. You sure you wanna go through with this?",JERRY,103,6
51,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to help her open a ketchup bottle. Hey, mom, let me ask you a question. Do you remember when you were a kid, your father winning like a thousand dollars at the track? (listens) Really? Did you know he gave uncle Leo a hundred dollars, and he was supposed to give you fifty? (listens) How do I know? Because Nana doesn't know what year it is, and she thinks this just happened. (listens) Well, I think you should. Okay, bye.",JERRY,103,6
52,Yeah?,JERRY,103,6
53,Come on up.,JERRY,103,6
54,"No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first opportunity to not kiss her hello.",JERRY,103,6
55,"It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in, you know you have to do this. I mean, if you could, say, touch a breast as part of the kiss hello, then I think I could see the value in it a little better.",JERRY,103,6
56,"Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.",JERRY,103,6
57,(muffled) Hi Wendy.,JERRY,103,6
58,(muffled) Would you like something to drink?,JERRY,103,6
59,(muffled) There you go.,JERRY,103,6
60,"Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.",JERRY,103,6
61,"So, how's everything going?",JERRY,103,6
62,"Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.",JERRY,103,6
63,"C'mon, that's not fair!",JERRY,103,6
64,"No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.",JERRY,103,6
65,"(throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do I care?",JERRY,103,6
66,"Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...",JERRY,103,6
67,...You can't put that picture up.,JERRY,103,6
68,"Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.",JERRY,103,6
69,(not really) Yeah.,JERRY,103,6
70,"Oh, sure, yeah.",JERRY,103,6
71,"Oh, no!",JERRY,103,6
72,You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!,JERRY,103,6
73,What is so funny?,JERRY,103,6
74,"Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He couldn't! (listens) Alright, I will. (listens) Okay, bye.",JERRY,103,6
75,(aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!,JERRY,103,6
76,(suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.,JERRY,103,6
77,(not as eager) Hi Joan.,JERRY,103,6
78,Pretty good.,JERRY,103,6
79,"Okay, great.",JERRY,103,6
80,"Oh, I'm delighted.",JERRY,103,6
81,You too.,JERRY,103,6
82,"Hi, Louise.",JERRY,103,6
83,"Ah, well. Thank you very much!",JERRY,103,6
84,"(agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like Richard Dawson down there now. And every person I see engages me in this long, boring, tedious, conversation. I can't even get out of the building!",JERRY,103,6
85,Family?,JERRY,103,6
86,"You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle pay interest on fifty dollars he was supposed to give my mother in nineteen-forty-one, and my uncle put my nana in a home to try and shut her up! And I tell you another thing, Cosmo Kramer, whatever you wanna be called. The kissing thing is over. There's no more kissing, and I don't care what the consequences are.",JERRY,103,6
87,"Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.",JERRY,103,6
88,"I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car with someone with a hairdo like that.",JERRY,103,6
89,You should have her work on it for you.,JERRY,103,6
90,Hi Mary.,JERRY,103,6
91,"Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry. It's nothing personal....",JERRY,103,6
92,...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it. I'm sorry.,JERRY,103,6
93,Hi Louise...,JERRY,103,6
94,"...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss hello thing anymore. (continues backing away) I'm sorry. I just can't do it. It's nothing personal, it's just I'm not really able to do it and uh, I'm sorry.",JERRY,103,6
95,(as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.,JERRY,103,6
96,Hello.,JERRY,103,6
97,"Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?",JERRY,103,6
98,"Okay, I will.",JERRY,103,6
99,"(locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing home.",JERRY,103,6
100,"Hey, Kramer, look at this.",JERRY,103,6
101,Look at my picture!,JERRY,103,6
102,I've been defaced!,JERRY,103,6
103,Hi Jack.,JERRY,103,6
104,"Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today, You think?",JERRY,103,6
105,"(defensive) No no, that's not true!",JERRY,103,6
106,"You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here, Because he's trying to prove he doesn't owe my mother fifty dollars.",JERRY,103,6
107,Buddy?,JERRY,103,6
108,So you were with him that day at the track?,JERRY,103,6
109,Leo?,JERRY,103,6
110,Is that so?,JERRY,103,6
111,"Well, that's very interesting.",JERRY,103,6
112,(standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours. (indicates Buddy) You remember Buddy. He just told me quite a story about you and Grandpa at the track.,JERRY,103,6
113,(with a triumphant point) You're busted!,JERRY,103,6
114,"Hey, Steve. How you doing?",JERRY,103,6
115,"Hey, Jeff. What's happening?",JERRY,103,6
116,"Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.",JERRY,103,6
117,"Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!",JERRY,103,6
118,"Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...",JERRY,103,6
119,Hey. Could I use your shower?,JERRY,103,6
120,"(pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.",JERRY,103,6
121,(impressed) Who's that?,JERRY,103,6
122,Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.,JERRY,103,6
123,"(rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.",JERRY,103,6
0,Say it's Saturday night in Spain. They go out dancing. You think they do the flamenco?,GEORGE,103,6
1,"So you could call a woman for a date, ask her if she's free for Dinner and a flamenco?",GEORGE,103,6

3,"Yes, I think I would.",GEORGE,103,6

7,"Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups. They should make it in a tube.",GEORGE,103,6
8,Ya-hah.,GEORGE,103,6
9,I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.,GEORGE,103,6
10,Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.,GEORGE,103,6
11,"Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.",GEORGE,103,6
12,"Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?",GEORGE,103,6
13,What?,GEORGE,103,6
14,"Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?",GEORGE,103,6

18,"You're uh, physical therapist, right?",GEORGE,103,6
19,"You know, I got this little swelling right here. (rolls up his sleeve to expose his wrist) It's kinda painful. What d'you make of it?",GEORGE,103,6
20,"(reluctant) Oh that uh, that seems like a lotta trouble.",GEORGE,103,6
21,(happy) Oh! Okay.,GEORGE,103,6

23,What?,GEORGE,103,6
24,I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.,GEORGE,103,6
25,Why not?,GEORGE,103,6
26,"I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting excited) They're so mentally gifted that we mustn't disturb the delicate genius unless it's in the confines of an office. (worked up) When huge sums of money are involved, then the delicate genius can be disturbed!",GEORGE,103,6
27,(wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so important...,GEORGE,103,6
28,(regarding the menu) What're you getting?,GEORGE,103,6
29,"Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.",GEORGE,103,6
30,"You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows her stuff. (he writes out a cheque)",GEORGE,103,6
31,"(tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There you go.",GEORGE,103,6

33,"(agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my mother to, to the chiropodist.",GEORGE,103,6
34,(harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's appointment? I had to take my mother to the chiropodist.,GEORGE,103,6
35,"(after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy! (to the world at large) The delicate genius has a policy! George heads for the door.",GEORGE,103,6

37,What d'you mean?,GEORGE,103,6
38,When did you leave the message?,GEORGE,103,6
39,"(pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice for a cancellation. Now, as I see it, you owe me seventy-five dollars.",GEORGE,103,6
40,"Will that be cash, or cheque?",GEORGE,103,6
41,"(irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine. Is that it? You're a delicate genius!",GEORGE,103,6
42,Elaine?,GEORGE,103,6
43,(leaving) Hah. Good luck.,GEORGE,103,6

5,(pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.,ELAINE,103,6
6,She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal with that outside of the office.,ELAINE,103,6
7,"Because, it is what she does.",ELAINE,103,6
8,"George, you got a little something, right here.",ELAINE,103,6
9,Why?,ELAINE,103,6
10,"Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.",ELAINE,103,6
11,"Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.",ELAINE,103,6
12,Yeah. Hah.,ELAINE,103,6
13,"No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.",ELAINE,103,6

21,"Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her hair.",ELAINE,103,6
22,"Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?",ELAINE,103,6
23,What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's face?,ELAINE,103,6

43,"(unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...",ELAINE,103,6
44,"She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a sudden, three blocks from my door, she decides this trip is over. Isn't that strange?",ELAINE,103,6
45,"I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as if I was hitch-hiking and she says ""Well, this is as far as I can take you.""",ELAINE,103,6
46,"I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I pinched a nerve in my shoulder.",ELAINE,103,6
47,"Yeah, alright, I gotta go.",ELAINE,103,6
48,(surprised) George!,ELAINE,103,6
49,"(feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when you dropped me off and I had to carry my skis, and my boots, and my poles and everything, all the way home. I'm, I'm having trouble lifting my arm. Do you think you could give me some treatment?",ELAINE,103,6

23,Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?,KRAMER,103,6
24,"Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to get to know one another.",KRAMER,103,6

38,(desperate) Don't you see what's going on here? He set us up. He's playing all these mindgames.,ELAINE,104,6
39,(worked up) There was nothing I could do. He said he had a Federal Express slip with your signature on it.,ELAINE,104,6

0,I hear you're going out with David Putty.,JERRY,107,6
1,"Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend of mine.",JERRY,107,6
2,"Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You don't want it to be someone you know, and you don't want it to be someone better than you. Now, even though the latter is *obviously* impossible.",JERRY,107,6
3,"The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I just can't see you with a mechanic.",JERRY,107,6
4,All right.,JERRY,107,6
5,Hi.,JERRY,107,6
6,"Yeah, so.",JERRY,107,6
7,What move?,JERRY,107,6
8,Wait a second. *My* move?,JERRY,107,6
9,David Putty used *my* move?,JERRY,107,6
10,Are you sure?,JERRY,107,6
11,I can't believe it. He *stole* my move.,JERRY,107,6
12,"Oh, it wasn't like that! I didn't even mention you. You know, we were in the garage. You know how garages are. They're conducive to sex talk. It's a high-testosterone area.",JERRY,107,6
13,"Well, I'm going down to that garage and telling him to stop doing it.",JERRY,107,6
14,What?,JERRY,107,6
15,No! He stole my move!,JERRY,107,6
16,"Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.",JERRY,107,6
17,"Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new. Besides which, I don't know how you could trust any of his moves now. His whole *repertoire* could be lifted.",JERRY,107,6
18,"I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.",JERRY,107,6
19,...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.,JERRY,107,6
20,Can I just get it opened first?,JERRY,107,6
21,"All right, all right. Here. (hands George a piece of the candy bar).",JERRY,107,6
22,You feel better?,JERRY,107,6
23,Nancy Klopper?,JERRY,107,6
24,"All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna make sure, before---",JERRY,107,6
25,"It's not even a question of that. The point is when something like this is passed along, one must be certain that it's going to be used in a *conscientious* way. This is not some parlor trick to be used---",JERRY,107,6
26,All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need a headboard.,JERRY,107,6
27,Is it padded?,JERRY,107,6
28,Good. How tall is she?,JERRY,107,6
29,"You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your heights. Otherwise, you could really hurt your neck.",JERRY,107,6
30,"George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone again.",JERRY,107,6
31,"Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I like the swirl. I'm comfortable with the swirl. *I* feel the swirl is a great capper. He uses the pinch, which I find a little presumptuous.",JERRY,107,6
32,"I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.",JERRY,107,6
33,What is it?,JERRY,107,6
34,When did you do this?,JERRY,107,6
35,Oh... Why Fusilli?,JERRY,107,6
36,"Well, thank you very much.",JERRY,107,6
37,Assman?,JERRY,107,6
38,"Who would order a license plate that says ""Assman""?",JERRY,107,6
39,It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It could be just some guy with a big ass.,JERRY,107,6
40,Yeah. Proctologist.,JERRY,107,6
41,I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.,JERRY,107,6
42,"Hey, David.",JERRY,107,6
43,"Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.",JERRY,107,6
44,What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used it on Elaine.,JERRY,107,6
45,"The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's nothing. You had *nothing*.",JERRY,107,6
46,Swirl.,JERRY,107,6
47,"Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.",JERRY,107,6
48,"You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other peoples? You're nothing but a hack.",JERRY,107,6
49,"Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna do it out of town...okay. But not in the city.",JERRY,107,6
50,Fine.,JERRY,107,6
51,You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed up the order. Did you close with the swirl?,JERRY,107,6
52,"Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression there. I told you to write it down.",JERRY,107,6
53,Yeah?,JERRY,107,6
54,C'mon up. (turns to George) You know what? Do me a favor. Don't even do the move anymore. You're gonna give it a bad name.,JERRY,107,6
55,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? Twenty-eight hundred dollars?!! That's the estimate on my car?!! No, don't even do anything. I'm gonna think about it. Okay, bye.",JERRY,107,6
56,Except that it's not Putty.,JERRY,107,6
57,"Eh, we had a little fight about the move. I took her to this other place. I think they might be trying to screw me.",JERRY,107,6
58,"Hey, Elaine.",JERRY,107,6
59,Is it something I said?,JERRY,107,6
60,Really?,JERRY,107,6
61,What is it?,JERRY,107,6
62,Huh.,JERRY,107,6
63,Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time you're gonna see him?,JERRY,107,6
64,You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this garage is trying to screw me.,JERRY,107,6
65,"Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke. Just kind of bring it up at the right time and find out. (hands Elaine the work order)",JERRY,107,6
66,"That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.",JERRY,107,6
67,Yeah. Kramer made it.,JERRY,107,6
68,"Hey, Assman!",JERRY,107,6
69,Hi.,JERRY,107,6
70,"Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping me off.",JERRY,107,6
71,"Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth this.",JERRY,107,6
72,Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do you know what a good mechanic is worth? You can't compare that to sex.,JERRY,107,6
73,"Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?",JERRY,107,6
74,I don't know. Why?,JERRY,107,6
75,What do you mean?,JERRY,107,6
76,"Really, stopping short. That's a good move.",JERRY,107,6
77,Hey.,JERRY,107,6
78,"Oh, my god!",JERRY,107,6
79,"If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.",JERRY,107,6
80,He had to use cork-screw pasta.,JERRY,107,6
81,Assman!,JERRY,107,6
0,"Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order a lobster here. I mean, do they bring a lobster in everyday hoping *todays* the day.",GEORGE,107,6
1,"You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television set. You take T.V. out of this relationship, it is *just* torture.",GEORGE,107,6
2,"An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.",GEORGE,107,6
3,"No, you're not a divorcee. Youÿre just separated. You're---you're a separatee.",GEORGE,107,6
4,"No, you're not out there.",GEORGE,107,6
5,"You're not out there! You can't be, because *I* am out there. And if I see *you* out there, there's not enough voltage in this world to electroshock me back into coherence!",GEORGE,107,6
6,Tuesday? I can't do it Tuesday. Steinbrenner needs me to run---,GEORGE,107,6
7,"Kramer, hey, hey! (Gets up out of his seat)",GEORGE,107,6
8,Come on over and sit down.,GEORGE,107,6
9,"No, you're gonna sit down, you son of a gun...",GEORGE,107,6
10,She's not out there!,GEORGE,107,6
11,"Hey, Kramer, what are you doing Tuesday?",GEORGE,107,6
12,Why doesn't *he* pick you up after the operation. He's got the car with the bench seats that you like.,GEORGE,107,6
13,"Well, giddy-up!",GEORGE,107,6
14,"You told David Putty your move and you didn't tell *me*? I *need* a move. You know I have no moves, Jerry. (points to the candy bar) Gimme a bite.",GEORGE,107,6
15,I can't believe you're hoarding sex moves. I'm out there rubbing two sticks together. You walk around with a zippo.,GEORGE,107,6
16,"(takes a bite) Oh, that's good. That's very good.",GEORGE,107,6
17,"Yeah, much better. All right, so what's the move, because I need *something*. This woman I'm dating, it's like she's doing her nails during love-making.",GEORGE,107,6
18,"Yeah. Never seen anyone so bored. I'm working like a dog here. Give me a moan. *Something*. I'd settle for a belch, for god's sake. All right, come on, let's have it.",GEORGE,107,6
19,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's in the vault. I'm putting it in the vault.",GEORGE,107,6
20,You're gonna tell me...or not.,GEORGE,107,6
21,I got a headboard.,GEORGE,107,6
22,No.,GEORGE,107,6
23,Five-foot four. Why?,GEORGE,107,6
24,I can't tell ya how much I appreciate this.,GEORGE,107,6
25,Is it a clockwise swirl?,GEORGE,107,6
26,"So, did you get your new plates?",GEORGE,107,6
27,What do they say?,GEORGE,107,6
28,Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.,GEORGE,107,6
29,Come on! No doctor would put that on his car.,GEORGE,107,6
30,"So, where you gonna stick this (points to the Fusilli Jerry)",GEORGE,107,6
31,"(pops his head out of the covers, looking a bit confused) Uh...you know, uh...pleasuring you.",GEORGE,107,6
32,You don't like the move?,GEORGE,107,6
33,You're kidding.,GEORGE,107,6
34,Sorry. I'll just go back to my usual routine.,GEORGE,107,6
35,Supposed to close with the swirl?,GEORGE,107,6
36,"Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.",GEORGE,107,6
37,"What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's what it is. He's not gonna cheat you.",GEORGE,107,6
38,What happened to Putty?,GEORGE,107,6
39,"Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you think? That's what they do. They can make up anything. Nobody knows. ""By the way, you need a new Johnson rod in there."" ""Oh, a Johnson rod. Yeah, well, you better put one of those on.""",GEORGE,107,6
40,Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle involved in any way?,GEORGE,107,6
41,I think that's mine.,GEORGE,107,6
42,"All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.",GEORGE,107,6
43,It just came to me.,GEORGE,107,6
44,You mean in the end?,GEORGE,107,6
45,A counter-clockwise swirl.,GEORGE,107,6
46,What?,GEORGE,107,6
47,Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.,GEORGE,107,6
48,It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.,GEORGE,107,6
49,"You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!",GEORGE,107,6
50,They say this guy's the best.,GEORGE,107,6
51,(stands up) I am.,GEORGE,107,6
52,"Ma, don't cry!",GEORGE,107,6
53,"Ma, your eyes!",GEORGE,107,6
0,"Yeah. What, is it a problem?",ELAINE,107,6
1,"Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has* been a few years.",ELAINE,107,6
2,"Oh, god.",ELAINE,107,6
3,"Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is work all day with their hands and their *big*, *muscular* arms on machines, and then they come home dripping with animal sexuality like Stanley Kowalski. What a huge turn-off that is.",ELAINE,107,6
4,Fine.,ELAINE,107,6
5,No.,ELAINE,107,6
6,"No, nothing.",ELAINE,107,6
7,I was with David *Putty* last night.,ELAINE,107,6
8,He did the move.,ELAINE,107,6
9,You know...*the* move.,ELAINE,107,6
10,"Yes, yes.",ELAINE,107,6
11,Jerry! There is no confusing *that* move with any other move.,ELAINE,107,6
12,What else did you tell (reaches over to slap Jerry) him. (does it again) The two of you must have had *quite* a little chat!,ELAINE,107,6
13,Because of all the pistons and the lube jobs?,ELAINE,107,6
14,"Well, wait---wait a second.",ELAINE,107,6
15,Isn't that a little...rash?,ELAINE,107,6
16,"Yeah, but...*I* like the move.",ELAINE,107,6
17,"Well, he doesn't even do it exactly the same. He--he--he uses a pinch at the end instead of the *swirl*!",ELAINE,107,6
18,"You know, it's strange, because he's such an honest mechanic.",ELAINE,107,6
19,"Oh, god! Oh, god, Dave! Oh, yes! Yes!",ELAINE,107,6
20,What?!!,ELAINE,107,6
21,What?,ELAINE,107,6
22,"Oh, oh, come on, please?",ELAINE,107,6
23,"Oh, so---so that's it?",ELAINE,107,6
24,"Yeah, yeah, hello.",ELAINE,107,6
25,Yes! As a matter of fact! David Putty won't do the move anymore.,ELAINE,107,6
26,"Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this thing.",ELAINE,107,6
27,"Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what it's like? It's like a big budget movie with a story that goes *nowhere*.",ELAINE,107,6
28,"I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up a lot of my time. And I...will not stand by and allow him to perform this move on me, when a perfectly good move is just sitting in the barn doing nothing!",ELAINE,107,6
29,"Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.",ELAINE,107,6
30,I'm not surprised.,ELAINE,107,6
31,Why?,ELAINE,107,6
32,An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?,ELAINE,107,6
33,(takes the work order and points to the Fusilli Jerry sitting on the table) What? What is this?,ELAINE,107,6
34,Fusilli Jerry?,ELAINE,107,6
35,Hi.,ELAINE,107,6
36,"Hey, let me ask you a question.",ELAINE,107,6
37,What do you charge for blown shocks?,ELAINE,107,6
38,"Two, three hundred?",ELAINE,107,6
39,Ah.,ELAINE,107,6
40,What about a bad gasket?,ELAINE,107,6
41,Yeah. Like a terrible gasket.,ELAINE,107,6
42,"Nothing, nothing. I'm just taking an interest in what you...do.",ELAINE,107,6
43,Oh...any kind of---of a Swedish car.,ELAINE,107,6
44,Oh.,ELAINE,107,6
45,Is that with the parts and labor?,ELAINE,107,6
46,Hmm.,ELAINE,107,6
47,"Oh, no. No, David. No, please. Not the knuckle....",ELAINE,107,6
48,So what are you going to do?,ELAINE,107,6
49,Oh! You mean you don't care if he does the move anymore?,ELAINE,107,6
50,Me either.,ELAINE,107,6
0,"Hi, little buddy.",KRAMER,107,6
1,"Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.",KRAMER,107,6
2,"All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? (Kisses Estelle on the cheek)",KRAMER,107,6
3,"Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best. You're out there now.",KRAMER,107,6

80,He did it.,JERRY,112,7
81,That's what's so fascinating.,JERRY,112,7
82,You better finish your little café latte there. They won't let you in with it.,JERRY,112,7

84,That's the rule.,JERRY,112,7
85,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me",JERRY,112,7
86,"Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip and keep it to ourselves.",JERRY,112,7

3,Isn't that why we have locks on the doors?,GEORGE,112,7
4,A backup system? We're designing bathroom doors with our legs exposed in anticipation of the locks not working? That's not a system. That's a complete breakdown of the system.,GEORGE,112,7
5,Why? What's wrong with the subject? This is a bad subject?,GEORGE,112,7
6,It's not that I want to keep talking about it? just think that the subject should resolve itself based on its own momentum.,GEORGE,112,7
7,(To himself) How am I gonna do this? I'm engaged to this woman? She doesn't even like me. Change the subject? Toilets were the subject. We don't even share the same interests.,GEORGE,112,7

9,"No, you haven't. Well, maybe you have. What do I know.",GEORGE,112,7

13,"Well, I told it to Susan before, and she didn't like it.",GEORGE,112,7

27,"Especially her. She does not like disappointment. Well, I have to do it. I can't make December. There's no way I can make December. Right? I mean, you can see that, right? I mean, look at me. Look. Look. Can I make December? I can't make December. Right? Look. Look.",GEORGE,112,7
28,"March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?",GEORGE,112,7

15,Aren't you concerned about the security guard?,GEORGE,113,7

23,"Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?",GEORGE,113,7
24,"What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that take? Here look at this. (he moves to the end of the booth) Here, watch. (stands up) Criminals. Boom. I'm up. (pretends he's shooting) Stop It! Stop It! Stop It!",GEORGE,113,7
25,Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair? I would be very interested to know how he felt about all of this. Maybe I'll have a talk with him.,GEORGE,113,7

30,"I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a chair.",GEORGE,113,7
31,"No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously a very well proportioned individual. I was just wondering, have they ever offered you a chair?",GEORGE,113,7
32,Would you like a chair?,GEORGE,113,7
33,"Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?",GEORGE,113,7
34,That's exactly my point.,GEORGE,113,7
35,"Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear one day and find you sitting down. (Starts to walk out of the store) That would give me a lot of pleasure. Call me crazy.",GEORGE,113,7
36,Who?,GEORGE,113,7
37,Bob Cobb?,GEORGE,113,7
38,Oh I missed the Maestro?,GEORGE,113,7
39,Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?,GEORGE,113,7
40,So what do you care?,GEORGE,113,7
41,Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany. Do you know how big Tuscany is?,GEORGE,113,7
42,It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.,GEORGE,113,7
43,It's a big region.,GEORGE,113,7
44,I don't know why I bother even talking to you.,GEORGE,113,7
45,All right.,GEORGE,113,7
46,So I spoke to the security guard.,GEORGE,113,7
47,"Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought him a chair, he'd sit.",GEORGE,113,7
48,Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool.,GEORGE,113,7
49,Oh I think I'd go for the back.,GEORGE,113,7
50,I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's chairs. What do you think of those.,GEORGE,113,7
51,You mean one of those vinyl things?,GEORGE,113,7
52,"Vinyl yeah, maybe.",GEORGE,113,7
53,"Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.",GEORGE,113,7
54,What do you think about a rocking chair?,GEORGE,113,7
55,What's your name?,GEORGE,113,7
56,I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking over this whole place someday so if I were you I would stay on my good side.,GEORGE,113,7
57,Innocent mistake.,GEORGE,113,7
58,"Well, here you go. What do you think?",GEORGE,113,7
59,"Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go ahead. Check it out.",GEORGE,113,7
0,"I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you. It was just the whole marriage thing.",ELAINE,113,7

10,What I mean who ever heard of this anyway? Suing a company because there coffee is too hot? Coffee is supposed to be hot.,ELAINE,113,7

22,"Yeah, so?",ELAINE,113,7
23,"Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny.",ELAINE,113,7
24,Maestro huh? O.K. (laughing),ELAINE,113,7
25,"Yeah, he's very interesting. Did you know that Mozart died while he was writing 'The Requiem'.",ELAINE,113,7

18,"Yeah, well you wouldn't be on that jury. He would have weeded you out.",KRAMER,113,7
19,Oh I can be quite litigious.,KRAMER,113,7

59,"(Speaking very fast and fidgety) You can't put a limit on my cafe lattes, it says so right here. And I don't want to get dirty looks when I come in here. If I want a cafe latte, you give me a cafe latte. And if I have any problems I'm gonna get my lawyer Jackie Chiles down here and your gonna be in really big trouble.",KRAMER,113,7
60,"Awe there making faces at me cause I've had a couple of cafe lattes. But I'm entitled to them. I can have as many cafe lattes as I want, that was the settlement.",KRAMER,113,7

1,"Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.",JERRY,114,7
2,I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.,JERRY,114,7
3,"You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.",JERRY,114,7
4,Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd possibly be walking around with a sponge.,JERRY,114,7
5,Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.,JERRY,114,7

34,"Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.",JERRY,114,7
35,I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there? (hides meat in napkin in jacket),JERRY,114,7
36,This is some FINE mutton.,JERRY,114,7
37,"Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)",JERRY,114,7

16,"(to Jean-Paul) Here, feel my hand. (takes off glove) Yeah, feel.",KRAMER,115,7
17,"Yeah, I turned up the heat.",KRAMER,115,7
18,I'm freezin'! I just need to get my hot tub running. I'm waiting for my new heat pump.,KRAMER,115,7
19,Uh? Oh that must be it.,KRAMER,115,7

7,"He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the other day, and I tell you this, you will be stunned.",JERRY,116,7
8,"You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.",JERRY,116,7
9,"There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is a little temperamental, especially about the ordering procedure. He's secretly referred to as the Soup Nazi.",JERRY,116,7
10,He yells and you don't get your soup.,JERRY,116,7
11,Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.,JERRY,116,7
12,All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to your right.,JERRY,116,7
13,The main thing is to keep the line moving.,JERRY,116,7
14,Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order. No extraneous comments. No questions. No compliments.,JERRY,116,7
15,Elaine.,JERRY,116,7
16,Ar-moire.,JERRY,116,7
17,He gave you the nice face discount.,JERRY,116,7

28,I gave you a taste. What do you want?,JERRY,116,7
29,"I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly flaunt the rules and then think I'm gonna share with you!",JERRY,116,7
30,I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.,JERRY,116,7
31,Hi shmoopy.,JERRY,116,7
32,You're a shmoopy!,JERRY,116,7
33,"Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?",JERRY,116,7
34,Why?,JERRY,116,7

43,It was a bisque.,JERRY,116,7
44,Really?,JERRY,116,7
45,Have you tastes the soup?,JERRY,116,7
46,"See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things up with Sheila than with the Soup Nazi.",JERRY,116,7
47,Hey.,JERRY,116,7
48,"Oh, thanks.",JERRY,116,7
49,"So, did these thieves want any money?",JERRY,116,7

51,Yeah?,JERRY,116,7
52,"Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange lately?",JERRY,116,7

67,No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.,JERRY,116,7
68,"What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's no truth to that. Nobody with a terminal illness goes from the United States to Europe for a piece of Bavarian cream pie and then when they get there and they don't have it he says "" Aw, I'll just have some coffee."" There's no truth to that.",JERRY,116,7
69,"So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?",JERRY,116,7

91,"Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which you obviously have. I think it's great that you're so open with your affections in public. See, we had that.",JERRY,116,7

23,Just like that.,GEORGE,116,7
24,No. I didn't get it.,GEORGE,116,7
25,I made a mistake.,GEORGE,116,7
26,"All right. Well, we'll see what happens to you.",GEORGE,116,7
27,"Yeah. Hey, let ask you something. Is it just me, or - or do you find it unbearable to be around Jerry and that girl?",GEORGE,116,7

29,What is that with the shmoopy?,GEORGE,116,7
30,"The shmoopy, shmoopy, shmoopy, shmmopy, shmoopy!",GEORGE,116,7

57,"Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story before. Someone who is unencumbered by any emotional attachment. Someone whose heart is so dark, it cannot be swayed by pity, compassion, or human emotion of any kind.",JERRY,123,7

24,"You remember what they did to me ten years ago? ""Oh, we'll be there in the morning between nine and one"", or ""We'll be there between two and six""! (quiet anger) And I sat there, hour after hour, without so much as a phone call. Finally, they show up, no apology, tracking mud all over my nice clean floors.

8,Yes.,GEORGE,125,7
9,"Wait a second, wait. Why are we together?",GEORGE,125,7
10,"Because, if you ever see her and it comes up, we have to be in sync. Hmm?",GEORGE,125,7
11,"Okay. Now, why do I have to see (points) you?",GEORGE,125,7
12,(dismissive) It's no good.,GEORGE,125,7
13,What?,GEORGE,125,7
14,"Hey, hey, let's not get so defensive here. This is a give and take process.",GEORGE,125,7
15,"(explaining, with lots of hand gestures) Okay, look. We've never worked together on a lie. Now, you don't understand how I work. I have a certain way of working. Jerry and I have worked together a few times. He knows how I work. It's not a personal thing, y'know? We're just trying to come up with the best possible lie. That's what this is all about.",GEORGE,125,7
16,Alright?,GEORGE,125,7
17,Okay.,GEORGE,125,7
18,Good.,GEORGE,125,7

26,That's your boyfriend.,GEORGE,125,7
27,He's an importer.,GEORGE,125,7
28,(getting irritated) He's an importer-exporter. Okay?,GEORGE,125,7
29,(thoughtful) Yes. Yes.,GEORGE,125,7
30,It's very complicated.,GEORGE,125,7
31,Wha..? I didn't tell you? I gotta go meet Elaine.,GEORGE,125,7
32,I don't know. She..She's having some problems with this guy she's seeing.,GEORGE,125,7
33,"Yeah, yeah. She's seeing this guy, Art Vandelay.",GEORGE,125,7
34,He's an importer-exporter.,GEORGE,125,7
35,"(not happy delivering Elaine's lie) Well, he uh, he wants to uh, quit the exporting and uh, focus just on the importing. And it's a problem, because she thinks the exporting is as important as the importing.",GEORGE,125,7
36,"(trying to laugh it off) Right. C'mon! I'm having an affair with Elaine?! If I was having an affair with Elaine, I wouldn't tell you I'm going to see Elaine. I would make up some other person to tell you I was gonna go see, and then I would go see Ela..Elaine.",GEORGE,125,7
37,"...So, anyway, if you think about it, manure is not really that bad a word. I mean, it's 'newer', which is good, and a 'ma' in front of it, which is also good. Ma-newer , right?",GEORGE,125,7
38,"What, you think I'm doing material here?",GEORGE,125,7
39,(modest) And I'm a little tired.,GEORGE,125,7

17,"Oh, so you wanna say you were with me?",ELAINE,125,7
18,"(pulls a face) Puh. Okay, fine. You were with me.",ELAINE,125,7
19,What is the difference?,ELAINE,125,7
20,"Ah! Because, I'm going to the dentist, and I'm afraid, and I want you to go with me.",ELAINE,125,7
21,(pointedly) Okay. Fine.,ELAINE,125,7
22,I don't like the way you just rejected my suggestion.,ELAINE,125,7
23,"I thought that my suggestion was good. And, I think you could've been a little more tactful.",ELAINE,125,7
24,(weary) Okay.,ELAINE,125,7
25,Okay.,ELAINE,125,7
26,Fine.,ELAINE,125,7

32,"(pointed) Yeah, right. The dentist thing.",ELAINE,125,7
33,"Okay, alright. What's his name? Who is he?",ELAINE,125,7
34,(incredulity) Art Vandelay? This is my boyfriend?,ELAINE,125,7
35,What does he do?,ELAINE,125,7
36,Just imports? No exports?,ELAINE,125,7
37,"Okay. So, I'm dating Art Vandelay. What is the problem we're discussing?",ELAINE,125,7
38,(sighs) Yi-yi-yi.,ELAINE,125,7
39,"Ah! (explaining, with hand gestures) How 'bout this? How about, he's thinking of quitting the exporting, and just focussing in on the importing. And this is causing a problem, because, why not do both?",ELAINE,125,7
40,"(irked) Oh, what? You don't like that suggestion either?",ELAINE,125,7
41,"(definitely irritated) You know, it seems to me that it's all you, and none of my ideas are getting in. You know, I mean, you just know it all and I am Miss Stupid. Right?",ELAINE,125,7
42,"Hi, Susan.",ELAINE,125,7
43,"Hi. Come in, come in. Have a seat.",ELAINE,125,7

51,It is so forgotten.,ELAINE,125,7
52,"Okay. (relieved) Okay, no problem.",ELAINE,125,7
53,"(unconvincing) Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, he was very helpful. (hesitant) Uhm, because, you know, Art and I were getting into this whole thing about his business. Uhm, you know he's an importer-exporter.",ELAINE,125,7
54,"(explaining, with gestures) Uhm, George felt that I was too adamant in my stand that Art should focus on the exporting and forget about the importing.",ELAINE,125,7
55,What'd I say?,ELAINE,125,7
56,(caught out) I did. Uh...,ELAINE,125,7

3,No.,JERRY,126,7
4,"No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.",JERRY,126,7
5,"Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment, my father left office in disgrace.",JERRY,126,7
6,"Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new development. Here's the pamphlet. Del Boca Vista. But they're not quite ready to go back so they're in seclusion here for a while at Uncle Leo's.",JERRY,126,7
7,"No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact, he moved in with her.",JERRY,126,7
8,"Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.",JERRY,126,7

21,"I'm used to a 1200 mile buffer zone. I can't handle this. Plus I got the dinners, I got the pop ins. They pop in! It's brutal!",JERRY,126,7
22,The only way out of this is if Leo breaks up with his girlfriend and has to move back into the apartment and then they would have to go back to Florida.,JERRY,126,7
23,(to himself) Once a week? (to Uncle Leo) So how's Lydia?,JERRY,126,7
24,I don't know how you do it.,JERRY,126,7

27,"Hey, it happens.",JERRY,126,7
28,He has no idea who you are.,JERRY,126,7
29,"All right. Anyway, the point I was making before Goerbbles made your hamburger is a man like you could be dating women twenty years younger. C'mon Uncle Leo, I've seen the way women look at you. When's the last time you looked in a mirror? You're an Adonis! You've got beautiful features, lovely skin, you're in the prime of your life here, you should be swinging. If I were you I'd tell this Lydia character, ""It's been real,"" move back into that bachelor pad and put out a sign; Open for business.",JERRY,126,7
30,"Well, keep looking.",JERRY,126,7
31,Yeah!,JERRY,126,7

36,"Oh, hi.",JERRY,126,7
37,"Actually, I'm drunk.",JERRY,126,7
38,"I know this doesn't seem like work to any of you, if you could perhaps conduct your psychopath convention down the hall, I could just get a little personal space.",JERRY,126,7

Lydia is laughing, Leo is not) I had lunch with him the other day, he's one of these guys that anything goes wrong in life, he blames it on anti-Semitism.

9,"Oh, okay..",JERRY,127,7
10,Ohh.. look at this..,JERRY,127,7
11,I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because of this,JERRY,127,7
12,"I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle, and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.",JERRY,127,7

23,"Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush I just got - the Ori-dent.",JERRY,127,7

36,Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and she made me carry that box?!,JERRY,127,7
37,It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to give to Charles Grodin on his show.,JERRY,127,7
38,"(While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge) In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her lap!",JERRY,127,7
39,"(Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!",JERRY,127,7
40,"Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.",JERRY,127,7
41,Why don't you just get rid of it?,JERRY,127,7
42,"Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.",JERRY,127,7
43,I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that? (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying),JERRY,127,7

45,"Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?",JERRY,127,7
46,"(Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric toothbrush I was telling you about?",JERRY,127,7
47,How come? I told you - It's fantastic.,JERRY,127,7
48,"I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better. Don't you believe me?",JERRY,127,7
49,(Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.,JERRY,127,7
50,Come in.,JERRY,127,7
51,"Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.",JERRY,127,7
52,How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?,JERRY,127,7
53,"(Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!",JERRY,127,7
54,"(Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!",JERRY,127,7
55,I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!,JERRY,127,7
56,(Peeved) I don't have any material!,JERRY,127,7
57,(Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.,JERRY,127,7
58,"Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all the time I'd be able to get some work done.",JERRY,127,7
59,(Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.,JERRY,127,7
60,"Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could talk about that on the show.",JERRY,127,7

62,"Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.",JERRY,127,7
63,(Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?,JERRY,127,7

70,"Well, I want to sit down.",JERRY,127,7
71,"It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in another.

6,"(Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family) When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.",GEORGE,127,7
7,I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are probably a million Costanzas-,GEORGE,127,7
8,Really? Why?,GEORGE,127,7
9,Who?,GEORGE,127,7
10,Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh.. the other guy.,GEORGE,127,7
11,"Hey, buddies.",GEORGE,127,7
12,Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys really hit it off.,GEORGE,127,7

14,"No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.",GEORGE,127,7
15,I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool table in my old bedroom.,GEORGE,127,7
16,What's all this?,GEORGE,127,7
17,(Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..,GEORGE,127,7

31,Come on. Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars. He made a bet he knew he was going to lose just to take you to dinner,JERRY,130,7

54,Peru! I paid $300 bucks for these. I could have bought a house in Peru for $300 bucks!,JERRY,130,7
55,I got to pay this Todd Gack guy $300 bucks just so he has some excuse to see Elaine again without asking her out.,JERRY,130,7
56,so what is Steinbrenner going to do if he doesn't get his calzones?,JERRY,130,7

7,So let me ask you a question about the tip jar. I had a little thing with the calzone guy this week. I go to drop a buck in the tip jar and just as I am about to drop it in he looks the other way. And then when I am leaving he gives me this look think thanks for nothing. I mean if they don't notice it what's the point.,GEORGE,130,7
8,Not bills.,GEORGE,130,7
9,Beautiful women. You know they could get away with murder. You never she any of them lift anything over three pounds. They get whatever they want whenever they want it. You can't stop them.,GEORGE,130,7

18,Yeah.,GEORGE,130,7
19,Well this is bad. I am really in a bad situation now.,GEORGE,130,7
20,What's he going to do? That's exactly the point. Nobody knows what this guy is capable of! He fires people like it is a bodily function.,GEORGE,130,7

21,"Lemme tell you something, that Jerry Lewis? You wonder how some of these people get to the top? It's ideas like this! Brilliant! Hah-hah! (Notices that the briefcase is damaged.) Look at this - what the hell happened? The whole side is damaged here...and the lock is broken.",GEORGE,136,8

42,"There are some people in this room who would have been very happy to never see this briefcase again.

And this tape recorder.",GEORGE,136,8
43,"You'll have your turn! The truth must be heard. (Plays back the tape.) That's all there was. And yet, it speaks volumes. A low rumple. A metallic 'squink.' A 'glonk.' Someone crying out...""Dear God!"" Let's start with, uh...with you, Wyck.",GEORGE,136,8

57,"Kramer, put the paper down! You never listen to me anymore! We hardly even talk!",JERRY,137,8

73,"(pause) If I get it for you, will you take me to that club an' show me a good time?",JERRY,137,8
74,Got it. (but now a man-hand grabs his arm) Uh!,JERRY,137,8

2,"I'm wearin' a little hat, I'm jumpin' through fire.. They're puttin' their little alien heads in my mouth..",GEORGE,137,8
3,"But in the zoo, you know, they might, put a woman in there with me to uh.. you know, get me to mate.",GEORGE,137,8

2,"(to JERRY) Remember I was telling you about Gillian, my friend who writes for the L.L. Bean catalogue? I really think you should give her a call.",ELAINE,137,8
3,(dry) I put her stats on the back.,ELAINE,137,8

5,"(dread) Uh. It's really not that bad, actually. He said he'd even go with me to the Museum of Miniatures. This is something you would never ever do.",ELAINE,137,8
6,"(wry, not impressed) Well you cracked it! I warned the Queen you were gettin' close an', now it looks like we're gonna have to move the whole damn forbidden city. (chuckles with JERRY)",ELAINE,137,8

18,"Yeah! An' he is a friend, Jerry. He is reliable. He is considerate. He's like your, exact opposite.",ELAINE,137,8
19,(pause) Bizarro Jerry?,ELAINE,137,8
20,"(pause) Shouldn't he say ""Bad bye""? Isn't that the, opposite of ""Good bye""?",ELAINE,137,8

32,Kevin and his friends are nice people! They do good things. They read..,ELAINE,137,8
33,"Books, Jerry.",ELAINE,137,8

47,"Get out! (pushes him back, but he falls back on the floor!)",ELAINE,137,8
48,"Oh, Kevin! I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do?",ELAINE,137,8
49,"(turning to them, awkward) It's locked..",ELAINE,137,8
0,"George, why couldn't I use the bathroom in that store?",KRAMER,137,8

2,"(impressed) Now, listen, uh. You better not wait. I'll catch you later.",KRAMER,137,8
3,"You know what happens with these? The rollers, they get flat spots on 'em. (hits button several times and whacks it)",KRAMER,137,8
4,"(absently wants to be part of it) Oh, yeah--yeah.. (follows them)",KRAMER,137,8

12,"T.C.B. You know, takin' care o' business. Aa--I gotta go.",KRAMER,137,8
13,"(leaving) I'll see you tonight, huh? (turning back, grabs his briefcase) Forget my briefcase.",KRAMER,137,8

16,"Just comin' in, an' that phone just wouldn't stop.",KRAMER,137,8

29,(in pain) Ow! Jeez!,KRAMER,137,8
30,(Ow!) It's my stomach.,KRAMER,137,8
31,"(putting briefcase down) You know what? You're right. These reports, they can wait a couple of hours. Whadda say we go out tonight? Any place you want.",KRAMER,137,8
32,"You got it, buddy.",KRAMER,137,8
33,Elaine!,KRAMER,137,8
34,"What did you want to see me about, Mr. Leland?",KRAMER,137,8

37,I don't even really work here!,KRAMER,137,8
0,Why not?,JERRY,138,8
1,What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out all the time.,JERRY,138,8
2,"No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs, and a monkey to answer the door, I'm back in business.",JERRY,138,8
3,"You were livin' in the village then, right?",JERRY,138,8

5,"Well, then you're drivin' me wild.",JERRY,138,8
6,"(George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?",JERRY,138,8
7,Like with dogs.,JERRY,138,8

12,Yeah I guess I do owe you.,JERRY,138,8
13,"No, I'm okay.",JERRY,138,8
14,"I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?",JERRY,138,8
15,"Yeah, so I didn't miss anything?",JERRY,138,8
16,Elaine danced?,JERRY,138,8
17,Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?,JERRY,138,8
18,For some time... (video of Elaine dancing on the street with Jerry and the street musicians watching her awful dance) It was about five years ago. I never knew what to say to her about it. It was one of those problems I hoped would just go away.,JERRY,138,8
19,And by then you've lost interest.,JERRY,138,8
20,What made him get that thing?,JERRY,138,8
21,Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer),JERRY,138,8
22,I don't even have the extra ticket yet.,JERRY,138,8
23,How could that be?,JERRY,138,8

27,"(Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.",JERRY,138,8
28,Really? I thought you were rebuffed.,JERRY,138,8
29,Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.,JERRY,138,8
30,"Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning, suddenly a phone call. Seems Elaine's made you the bad boy. And Anna digs the bad boy.",JERRY,138,8
31,"You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...",JERRY,138,8
32,"The bad fiancé&Mac226;, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit risk...",JERRY,138,8
33,"The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at table as George exits) The bad tipper!",JERRY,138,8

35,That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.,JERRY,138,8
36,I'm a joke maker.,JERRY,138,8
37,"(To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?",JERRY,138,8
38,Does what?,JERRY,138,8
39,May I see you outside for a moment please?,JERRY,138,8
40,Outside!,JERRY,138,8
41,What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?,JERRY,138,8
42,It's not legitimate.,JERRY,138,8
43,Where did you meet this guy?,JERRY,138,8
44,Kramer. (boom sound),JERRY,138,8
45,I don't believe this. (They run into theater),JERRY,138,8
46,"Hey, what is going on over there?",JERRY,138,8
47,Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.,JERRY,138,8
48,"Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.",JERRY,138,8
49,"All right, I'm, i,m takin' the camera.",JERRY,138,8
50,Oh man...,JERRY,138,8
51,How was the rest of Death Blow?,JERRY,138,8
52,"Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!",JERRY,138,8
53,"You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!",JERRY,138,8
54,"What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.",JERRY,138,8
55,What if I didn't do it right?,JERRY,138,8
56,People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns. Too many misunderstandings.,JERRY,138,8
57,Hi.,JERRY,138,8
58,Yeah.,JERRY,138,8
59,What?,JERRY,138,8
60,"Well, I did the best I could.",JERRY,138,8
61,I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.,JERRY,138,8
62,We're talkin' federal crime here.,JERRY,138,8
63,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when you shot this?",JERRY,138,8
64,Do you even know what this scene is about?,JERRY,138,8
65,"No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of his soul.",JERRY,138,8
66,Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody and telling him I shot it.,JERRY,138,8
67,"I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today, there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs, because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.",JERRY,138,8
68,I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing. Where are my magic markers?,JERRY,138,8
69,I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away),JERRY,138,8
70,"All right, you're beyond stink.",JERRY,138,8
71,"And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin' trouble with your staff, not because of George.",JERRY,138,8
72,"Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah, please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the laundry. I'll be right back.",JERRY,138,8

10,"I'm tellin' you Jerry I'm gettin' a vibe. If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff completely lost respect for me. (Staff mocks her dancing in the background)",ELAINE,138,8
11,"Jerry, it's like the feeling is palpable. You think it could have something to do with the party?",ELAINE,138,8
12,"Ah, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.",ELAINE,138,8

30,Who did that? Who did that?!?,ELAINE,138,8
31,"Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun. We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing, Kramer flips out) What?",ELAINE,138,8

41,I never should have given Anna the impression--,ELAINE,138,8
42,"--that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.",ELAINE,138,8
43,What?,ELAINE,138,8
44,I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?,ELAINE,138,8

16,How do you know?,GEORGE,144,8
17,"51 people?! That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!",GEORGE,144,8

25,"Well, all vacations have to end eventually.",GEORGE,144,8
26,"(Holding up Kramer's book) According to this, it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So, uh, Clarence, how about abandoning this apartment, and letting me shove off in this beauty?",GEORGE,144,8
27,"(Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge! The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!",GEORGE,144,8
28,"So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've been suffering for the past 30 years up to and including yesterday!",GEORGE,144,8
29,(Interested) I should!,GEORGE,144,8

38,"I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear, (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was attractive.. She was, also, infact, a Nazi.. (Cuts to another story) The water.. that I had been swiming in was.. very cold. And, when I dropped the towel, there was.. significant shrinkage.. (Scene cuts to, yet, another story) Her parents were looking at me.. So, there I was, with a marble rye hanging from the end of a fishing pole.. (Scene cuts to his closing statements) In closing, these stories have not been embellished, because - they need no embellishment. They are simply, horrifyingly, the story of my life as a short, stocky, slow witted bald man. (Gets up) Thank you. (Every memeber of the board shows some sign that George's story is most deserving of the apartment. Ricardi is crying. George turns to leave, then remembers one more thing..) Oh, also.. my fiance died from licking toxic envelopes that I picked out. (Sobs and loud crying erupts from the board members) Thanks again. (Leaves. Eldridge looks defeated)",GEORGE,144,8

45,"Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned it with 34 years of misery!",GEORGE,144,8

10,"(Leans in close) Between you and me, what happened there with the stabbing?",ELAINE,144,8

14,"(Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you don't mean, but he means them.",ELAINE,144,8
15,"Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important parts of a relationship.",ELAINE,144,8
16,(Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What? Break-up? We went out on one date.,ELAINE,144,8
17,"(Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good. Good.",ELAINE,144,8

23,Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?,ELAINE,144,8
24,"(Gives a ""That's a shame"" face) Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of Kramer's coughs, then walks off)",ELAINE,144,8
25,What?,ELAINE,144,8
26,(Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?,ELAINE,144,8
27,Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant freak-head. (Sits down),ELAINE,144,8
28,"(Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!",ELAINE,144,8
29,"(Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or jam a fork into his forehead.",ELAINE,144,8
30,(Getting up to leave) Alright.,ELAINE,144,8

39,"Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl. Very smart. Very eh...crafty.",GEORGE,145,8

41,"No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.",GEORGE,145,8

12,(shouting) I'm not looking for another line. I got the line.,GEORGE,147,8
13,"(really animated) Alright, alright. You see? This is why I hate writing with a large group. Everybody has their own little opinions, and it all gets homogenised, and you lose the whole edge of it. I'm going with jerk store! Jerk store is the line! Jerk store! Yess!",GEORGE,147,8
14,"Wha..wait a minute, wha..what about Reilly?",GEORGE,147,8
15,(surprise) What? I..I didn't hear about that.,GEORGE,147,8

24,Yep. I'm leaving first thing tomorrow morning.,GEORGE,147,8

26,"(adamant) It's smart. It's a smart line, and a smart crowd will appreciate it. (shouting) And, I'm not gonna dumb it down for some bonehead mass audience!",GEORGE,147,8

88,I don't know what that could be.,JERRY,150,8
89,"Anyway, I'm a new man, and I'm looking towards the future. Clean, dirty, whatever.",JERRY,150,8
90,Holy cow! Have a nice life.,JERRY,150,8

I like those chocolate chip ones. Then I figured, well, they're really both cake. So I, uh, I sat on that bench for a little while, twenty minutes or an hour, and then I figured, check and see what you were up to. (a thought occurs to him) Wait a minute, wait a minute. The broad jump! The broad jump over the pothole on Eighty-sixth Street!",GEORGE,150,8
16,"Now I remember, as I jumped over the hole I heard a, like a jingling sound.",GEORGE,150,8

15,"Jer, do you see where this is going?",ELAINE,150,8
16,"Jerry, you have tendencies. They're always annoying, but they were just tendencies. But now, if you can't kiss this girl, I'm afraid we're talking disorder.",ELAINE,150,8
17,"And from disorder, you're a quirk or two away from full-on dementia.",ELAINE,150,8
18,Shall we stop and say hi?,ELAINE,150,8
19,Yeah.,ELAINE,150,8
20,"Hi. I'm your neighbour, uh, fr... from across the street. And uh, (coughs nervously) I was wondering, if it wouldn't be too much trouble, if I could use your apartment to order some food?",ELAINE,150,8

7,"They try to push you into using their cleaning crew, with all their so-called maintenance equipment.",KRAMER,150,8

29,That stuff is unbelievable. I'd eat it out of a dumpster.,KRAMER,150,8

34,Kramer said I was supposed to bring him back some Cubans.,JERRY,151,8
35,"(animated) They're real Cubans?! They're human beings, from Cuba?!",JERRY,151,8
36,Cigars!,JERRY,151,8

8,Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.,JERRY,153,8
9,"Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish jokes.",JERRY,153,8
10,Booze is not a religion.,JERRY,153,8
11,"Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.",JERRY,153,8
12,I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.,JERRY,153,8
13,What're you doing here?,JERRY,153,8
14,Well this is very awkward.,JERRY,153,8
15,"Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.",JERRY,153,8
16,"All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here. (Tim and his staff enter)",JERRY,153,8
17,George...,JERRY,153,8
18,Hey.,JERRY,153,8
19,"Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?",JERRY,153,8
20,"I know, but...",JERRY,153,8
21,5000.,JERRY,153,8
22,And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.,JERRY,153,8
23,I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings),JERRY,153,8
24,Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter),JERRY,153,8
25,"All right, take it easy.",JERRY,153,8
26,How you doing?,JERRY,153,8
27,"Whatley. (Like ""Newman"")",JERRY,153,8
28,"So Whatley sayd to me, ""Hey, I can make Catholic jokes, I used to be Catholic.""",JERRY,153,8
29,"Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.",JERRY,153,8
30,I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.,JERRY,153,8
31,They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to lunch?,JERRY,153,8
32,Poor Beth.,JERRY,153,8

39,"Hmm, I really need to speak with him.",JERRY,153,8
40,Oh. (Adjusts accordingly),JERRY,153,8
41,Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.,JERRY,153,8
42,"Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley. I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.",JERRY,153,8
43,"No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you that he's also telling Catholic jokes.",JERRY,153,8
44,"And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch in a lifeboat.",JERRY,153,8
45,"Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada yada yada, and she says, ""Those aren't buoys."" (Father starts laughing) Father...",JERRY,153,8

53,Date with Karen?,JERRY,153,8
54,What happened to Karen?,JERRY,153,8
55,"Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people children?",JERRY,153,8
56,So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got all offended. Those people can be so touchy.,JERRY,153,8
57,What?,JERRY,153,8
58,"Kramer, he's just a dentist.",JERRY,153,8
59,I am not an anti-dentite!,JERRY,153,8
60,They do have their own schools!,JERRY,153,8
61,"Well, what's wrong?",JERRY,153,8
62,Talk to me.,JERRY,153,8
63,"Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.",JERRY,153,8
64,Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.,JERRY,153,8
65,"Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)",JERRY,153,8
66,I'm kinda in the middle of something.,JERRY,153,8
67,"Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.",JERRY,153,8

15,"Hey, what this thing? Whew!",GEORGE,153,8
16,"Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?",GEORGE,153,8
17,"Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)",GEORGE,153,8

8,"Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny. Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've seen... doesn't matter.

9,Why are you so concerned about this?,ELAINE,153,8
10,"Hey, hey, hey!",ELAINE,153,8
11,"Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea. Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.",ELAINE,153,8
12,"Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?",ELAINE,153,8
13,Really.,ELAINE,153,8

15,"Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.",ELAINE,153,8
16,"You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!",ELAINE,153,8
17,So what're you gonna do?,ELAINE,153,8
18,"(Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.",ELAINE,153,8

82,"By the way Newman, I'm just curious. When you booked the hotel, did you book it for the millennium New Year?",JERRY,154,8
83,"Oh, that's interesting, because as everyone knows, since there was no year zero, the millennium doesn't begin until the year two-thousand and one. Which would make your party, one year late, and thus, quite lame.",JERRY,154,8

12,...meet the Mets. Come on in and greet the Mets.,GEORGE,154,8
13,"There was no meeting. (gets one of the folding chairs) But it was quite a meeting. You are looking at the next director of Mets scouting. The only thing is, I have to get fired from the Yankees first.",GEORGE,154,8
14,"Of course. But I really wanna leave my mark this time, you know, uh. I wanna walk away from the Yankees with people saying 'Wow! Now that guy got canned!'",GEORGE,154,8

25,"You wanted to see me, sir?",GEORGE,154,8
26,"Oh, yes. I already packed up my desk, sir. I can be outta here in an hour.",GEORGE,154,8
27,Never thought I'd fail at failing.,GEORGE,154,8
28,(depressed) Feel like I can't do anything wrong.,GEORGE,154,8
29,(hopeful) Everything?,GEORGE,154,8
30,You really think so?,GEORGE,154,8
31,"Alright. I guess I just have to pick myself up, dust myself off, and throw myself right back down again!",GEORGE,154,8

19,"Oh no! Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like a weed, Jerry.",GEORGE,158,9
20,Im a weed in Hitlers bunker.,GEORGE,158,9

38,Well played.,GEORGE,158,9
39,You have to drink that whole thing?,GEORGE,158,9
40,Would a giant rubber ball work?,GEORGE,158,9
41,"Well, Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont we test your bladder system at my office?",GEORGE,158,9
42,"Oh, yes I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing dirtier than a giant ball of oil.",GEORGE,158,9
43,(again from bathroom) Witness.,GEORGE,158,9
44,"Oh, you might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong man to hire because he was fake handicapped.",GEORGE,158,9
45,KRAMER & GEORGE: No. No,GEORGE,158,9
46,"Hey, use mine. Ill let you in.",GEORGE,158,9

26,Ugh!,ELAINE,158,9
27,Hey!,ELAINE,158,9
28,"No money, I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?",ELAINE,158,9
29,"I am not calling Puddy. What did I do with my gloves? Oh, I bet I left them over at Puddys. I should call him. I need those gloves. No, I better not. Ill call. (looks at table) Oh, look at that! There are the gloves. I was just about to call. There they are. Thats funny. Thats really funny. Thats really really funny. You know who loves funny stories, David Puddy. (Picks up phone).",ELAINE,158,9

47,Im going to get some popcorn.,ELAINE,158,9
48,"So, how did it end?",ELAINE,158,9
49,uh.,ELAINE,158,9
50,"Listen David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?",ELAINE,158,9
51,"See, this is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling ourselves. We belong together.",ELAINE,158,9

2,"Look at this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.",KRAMER,158,9
3,"Of course its a good idea, its my idea. I conceived this whole project two years ago.",KRAMER,158,9
4,"You see I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing happens. You know why?",KRAMER,158,9
5,"(interrupts) No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry, grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any idea how much time I waste in this apartment?",KRAMER,158,9
6,Here we go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!,KRAMER,158,9
7,Hoochie moochie. (haha),KRAMER,158,9
8,"(still reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun (Sp?). That was my idea too!",KRAMER,158,9
9,"So thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to, you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead and look through some of the drawers.",KRAMER,158,9
10,"Yeah, thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont you go across the hall and get started on that mail.",KRAMER,158,9
11,Hes a go getter!,KRAMER,158,9
12,"My intern from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.",KRAMER,158,9
13,"Well, apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting some real world corporate experience.",KRAMER,158,9
14,"Well, this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important things, like my bladder system.",KRAMER,158,9
15,"Jerry, its not for people, its for oil tankers.",KRAMER,158,9
16,"You see the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes, the oil wont spill out.",KRAMER,158,9
17,(smiles) yeah.,KRAMER,158,9
18,"Yeah, 5.",KRAMER,158,9
19,What? When did this happen?,KRAMER,158,9
20,(yelling) DARREN!,KRAMER,158,9
21,"Sorry I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his ""intern"")",KRAMER,158,9
22,Uh huh,KRAMER,158,9
23,"Boysenberry, the kid is still learning.",KRAMER,158,9
24,"Yeah, well nothing before noon.",KRAMER,158,9
25,"Yeah, your phone is line one.",KRAMER,158,9
26,"Dean Jones, you wanting to talk to me?",KRAMER,158,9
27,Yeah.,KRAMER,158,9
28,"I know it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.",KRAMER,158,9
29,"And with Darrens help, well get that chicken.",KRAMER,158,9
30,"Well, I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.",KRAMER,158,9
31,I dont know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners. Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?,KRAMER,158,9
32,I was supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.,KRAMER,158,9
33,"Jerry, buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.",KRAMER,158,9
34,So played.,KRAMER,158,9
35,Darren? What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.,KRAMER,158,9
36,Kramerica is no more.,KRAMER,158,9
37,"Probably. Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.",KRAMER,158,9
38,"Well, youre still here?",KRAMER,158,9
39,"Well, I havent changed my mind.",KRAMER,158,9

41,Lets see what Jerry has to eat.,KRAMER,158,9
42,Hey.,KRAMER,158,9
43,Its a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder system.,KRAMER,158,9
44,No. No. No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or not it can restrain the impact.,KRAMER,158,9
45,Conceivably.,KRAMER,158,9
46,Did you bring the video camera?,KRAMER,158,9
47,You gave up the voice?,KRAMER,158,9
48,"Whew. You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.",KRAMER,158,9
49,Bombs away (Uh oh).,KRAMER,158,9
50,"Well, that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard in the same bottle?",KRAMER,158,9
51,Yeah.,KRAMER,158,9
52,Darren is going away for a long long time.,KRAMER,158,9
53,(doing the voice) La la la.,KRAMER,158,9

9,"Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all my food. Now shut that door and get the hell out of here!",JERRY,159,9
10,"Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.",JERRY,159,9
11,Fix a screen door in Queens.,JERRY,159,9
12,Not goin' to the Knick game.,JERRY,159,9
13,"You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering. You should be able to buy a cheaper gift.",JERRY,159,9

23,Tongue?,JERRY,159,9
24,Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.,JERRY,159,9
25,"Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not want to stop over in Cincinnati. Well, then you upgrade me. That's right, you should thank me. Goodbye. (Hangs up) Hey, I'm flyin' first class.",JERRY,159,9
26,Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?,JERRY,159,9

36,'Maybe'!?,JERRY,159,9
37,"Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer, sitting on his lawn chair with a sparkler)",JERRY,159,9
38,"Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to talk about it!",JERRY,159,9
39,"That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there also, but I wasn't in the mood.",JERRY,159,9
40,It's Patty.,JERRY,159,9
41,(Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?,JERRY,159,9
42,This is horrible! I care!,JERRY,159,9
43,Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without her.,JERRY,159,9
44,I don't know what's happening to me.,JERRY,159,9
45,That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.,JERRY,159,9

67,You don't look well.,JERRY,159,9
68,"Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.",JERRY,159,9
69,He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?,JERRY,159,9
70,"George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've ever done. Sure I'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations. How about you?",JERRY,159,9

3,What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?,GEORGE,159,9
4,Why does she want you to be mad?,GEORGE,159,9
5,So what do you care what she thinks.,GEORGE,159,9
6,She probably gets that impression because you're cool. You're under control. Like me. Nothing wrong with that.,GEORGE,159,9
7,Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic pitch. (Kramer enters),GEORGE,159,9
8,"I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help me fix my father's screen door in Queens?",GEORGE,159,9
9,Really? You wanna come?,GEORGE,159,9

19,"Morning, dad.",GEORGE,159,9
20,What is Lloyd Braun doing here?,GEORGE,159,9
21,"Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing up is 'Why can't you be more like Lloyd Braun?' Did you know he was in a mental institution?",GEORGE,159,9
22,(Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?,GEORGE,159,9
23,"You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!",GEORGE,159,9

35,"Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.",GEORGE,159,9
36,It means a non-Jewish woman.,GEORGE,159,9
37,You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of meeting a woman that's not like their mother.,GEORGE,159,9
38,I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get you on a new desktop computer.,GEORGE,159,9
39,There's porn.,GEORGE,159,9
40,Damn it!,GEORGE,159,9
41,"(Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers) Jerry, I've found a way to beat Lloyd Braun! I buy the computers myself, I store 'em in your apartment.

42,(Leaving) I'll store these over at Kramer's apartment.,GEORGE,159,9
43,"(using the phone) Watch how it's done. Oh, hello, Mr. Vandelay? Would you like to buy a computer? Oh, really? Two dozen?",GEORGE,159,9
44,What do you know? You were in the nut house.,GEORGE,159,9
45,I heard they found a family in your freezer,GEORGE,159,9
46,Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!,GEORGE,159,9
47,"Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?",GEORGE,159,9
48,Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls to get your stress out? Why did you have to destroy *twenty-five* computers?,GEORGE,159,9
49,"Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't handle it.",GEORGE,159,9
50,All right... here goes...,GEORGE,159,9

8,Where did that come from?,ELAINE,159,9
9,No.,ELAINE,159,9
10,"So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology accepted.",ELAINE,159,9
11,"Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and tell Mitchell Tanenbaum that I will be unable to attend this Saturday.",ELAINE,159,9
12,"I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and I am in my early... 20s.",ELAINE,159,9
13,"No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become a man. I mean, half my friends aren't even there yet.",ELAINE,159,9
14,"(Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.",ELAINE,159,9
15,"Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your father. It takes time. Patience, experience. Uh, several careers of varying success. And these are things I look for in a man.",ELAINE,159,9
16,"Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.",ELAINE,159,9
17,Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts making out with her),ELAINE,159,9
18,(Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!,ELAINE,159,9
19,Did you and Patty just break up?,ELAINE,159,9
20,"Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard about this great place called La Caridad.",ELAINE,159,9
21,Whoa. What is the matter?,ELAINE,159,9
22,"Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.",ELAINE,159,9
23,Oh my God. You're crying.,ELAINE,159,9
24,So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.,ELAINE,159,9
25,What?,ELAINE,159,9
26,"I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have to do with it?",ELAINE,159,9
27,"Oh, that's insane.",ELAINE,159,9
28,I am not buying a computer from you.,ELAINE,159,9
29,(Pausing) Even so.,ELAINE,159,9
30,"Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to... lunge at me. Huh. But the only reason you like me is because I'm a shiksa.",ELAINE,159,9
31,"If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.",ELAINE,159,9
32,"Oh, no. Don't!",ELAINE,159,9
33,Oy vey!,ELAINE,159,9
34,"(Enters) Hey, what happened to you?",ELAINE,159,9
35,Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is renounced. This shiksa thing is *totally* out of control. What is *with* you people? What are you looking at?,ELAINE,159,9
36,"Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.",ELAINE,159,9
37,Do you have an apple or anything?,ELAINE,159,9
38,Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.,ELAINE,159,9
39,"Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!",ELAINE,159,9
40,What?,ELAINE,159,9
41,"Uhh, Jerry, I've got a lot goin' on with, uh, Lippman right now.",ELAINE,159,9
42,"(Trying to get her bag to leave) Yeah, and him too. What?! Oh, yeah! I think George is calling me, so I'm gonna go give him a hand. Come on! Come on!",ELAINE,159,9
43,No. Stay! Stay. Stay.,ELAINE,159,9
44,"Rabbi, is there anything I can do to combat this Shiks-appeal?",ELAINE,159,9
45,"Well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied Israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.",ELAINE,159,9
46,"(About to leave) Well, what does that have to do...?",ELAINE,159,9
47,"All right, Jerome, I'm in.",ELAINE,159,9
48,Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is right here in front of us. Jer... let's do it.,ELAINE,159,9
49,What? What happened to the new Jerry?,ELAINE,159,9
50,"Oh, well that's just *great!*",ELAINE,159,9

4,(Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the screen door. (Takes picture) Perfect.,KRAMER,159,9
5,"It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked hard for ya.",KRAMER,159,9
6,"Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen door)",KRAMER,159,9
7,Yeah.,KRAMER,159,9
8,"Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got a little life in her yet.",KRAMER,159,9
9,"(Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA. Let's see how this baby closes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.",KRAMER,159,9
10,"(Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.",KRAMER,159,9
11,"Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.",KRAMER,159,9
12,(Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.,KRAMER,159,9
13,"Hey, buddy!",KRAMER,159,9
14,(Getting the door slammed on him) Y'all come back reeeaall...,KRAMER,159,9
15,"She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?",KRAMER,159,9
16,"Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come with it. It's like Endora's box.",KRAMER,159,9
17,"Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)",KRAMER,159,9
18,"(Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's it! I warned you kids. I told you not to play in front of my house. This time, I'm keepin' it. And you're not getting back your rock either!",KRAMER,159,9
19,"Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn my back for two seconds, and they put shaving cream all over my door. You, I see you! I'll teach these kids a lesson. Where's that house I put under your sink?",KRAMER,159,9
20,"I love you, too, buddy, and George--",KRAMER,159,9
21,"Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn this water on full blast.",KRAMER,159,9
22,"I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'",KRAMER,159,9
23,"On the signal, George. On the signal.",KRAMER,159,9
24,"Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the faucet! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mama! Hoochie mamamaaaaa!",KRAMER,159,9
25,Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They ambushed me with a box of 'Grade A's.,KRAMER,159,9
26,"Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity now.",KRAMER,159,9
27,"(Trying to open a back of chips) Jerry, the anger, it just melts right off. Serenity now. Look at this. Serenity now!",KRAMER,159,9
28,Serenity! (He exits),KRAMER,159,9
29,"Serenity now, serenity now...",KRAMER,159,9
30,"Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children, they've done sum redecorating. Serenity now, serenity now.",KRAMER,159,9
31,"Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with the world- uh! eggs! you! Serenity now, serenity now, serenity now.",KRAMER,159,9
32,"(going into his apartment) Jerry, come on. Don't get upset about it. There's always next spring. Now will you excuse me for a moment. Serenity nooooooooww!",KRAMER,159,9
33,(crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!,KRAMER,159,9
34,(Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!,KRAMER,159,9
35,"(Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.",KRAMER,159,9
0,Are you sure you can't stay longer?,JERRY,160,9
1,He was 96 years old.,JERRY,160,9
2,"Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.",JERRY,160,9
3,Really?,JERRY,160,9
4,Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?,JERRY,160,9
5,Did you give blood?,JERRY,160,9
6,In case of what?,JERRY,160,9
7,Are we finished?,JERRY,160,9
8,"Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first thing they ask is: who's responsible for this?",JERRY,160,9
9,"What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?",JERRY,160,9
10,What?,JERRY,160,9
11,"Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?",JERRY,160,9
12,"Elaine, what do you think?",JERRY,160,9
13,"Didn't go for it, huh?",JERRY,160,9
14,"So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?",JERRY,160,9
15,"Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man and a sandwich.",JERRY,160,9
16,"Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about satisfying one of somebody else's.",JERRY,160,9
17,"I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.",JERRY,160,9
18,What the hell is that?,JERRY,160,9
19,"Oh, why?",JERRY,160,9
20,"What, it...it's here in the building?",JERRY,160,9
21,"No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.",JERRY,160,9
22,You know it and I ditched all my junk food.,JERRY,160,9
23,"Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.",JERRY,160,9
24,Is this about me?,JERRY,160,9
25,"Oh, then I lost interest.",JERRY,160,9
26,"Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting at Vivian's.",JERRY,160,9
27,"Oh no, where's the blood? (opens the fridge) It's in here isn't it?",JERRY,160,9
28,What is this?,JERRY,160,9
29,What about this? This is blood isn't it?!,JERRY,160,9
30,"Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!",JERRY,160,9
31,"Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?",JERRY,160,9
32,"Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here anymore...",JERRY,160,9
33,Aaah...,JERRY,160,9
34,Aah!,JERRY,160,9
35,I can see that! What happened?,JERRY,160,9
36,I'll remember that.,JERRY,160,9
37,What?,JERRY,160,9
38,I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.,JERRY,160,9
39,"So, how's the fornicating gourmet?",JERRY,160,9
40,"George, we're trying to have a civilization here.",JERRY,160,9
41,"Hey, how was baby-sitting?",JERRY,160,9
42,"Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.",JERRY,160,9
43,Really?,JERRY,160,9
44,I'm not touching that thing.,JERRY,160,9
45,"Oh, no...",JERRY,160,9
46,"Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.",JERRY,160,9
47,"All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.",JERRY,160,9
48,Hello?,JERRY,160,9
49,Kramer called you?,JERRY,160,9
50,"Yes, I'm fine.",JERRY,160,9
51,"I don't need a personal trainer. (Kramer comes in) all right I've got to go, we'll talk about this later.",JERRY,160,9
52,Why are you calling my parents?,JERRY,160,9
53,Why here?,JERRY,160,9
54,Ok...,JERRY,160,9
55,Fine...,JERRY,160,9
56,No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!,JERRY,160,9
57,All right.,JERRY,160,9
58,Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?,JERRY,160,9
59,"Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?",JERRY,160,9
60,"Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?",JERRY,160,9
61,For what?,JERRY,160,9
62,How many session did my parents paid for?,JERRY,160,9
63,What is this?,JERRY,160,9
64,I thought you were gonna watch a video.,JERRY,160,9
65,"Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.",JERRY,160,9
66,"Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter house.",JERRY,160,9
67,No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...,JERRY,160,9
68,"So, the free love buffet is over?",JERRY,160,9
69,"Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.",JERRY,160,9
70,What's going on?,JERRY,160,9
71,"Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.",JERRY,160,9
72,"No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.",JERRY,160,9
73,"All right, that's enough of that. (Jerry takes the plates and hands them to a waitress.)",JERRY,160,9
74,"Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.",JERRY,160,9
75,"It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.",JERRY,160,9
76,What's wrong with yours?,JERRY,160,9
77,"All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!",JERRY,160,9
78,Is this really necessary?,JERRY,160,9
79,What if I can't keep up?,JERRY,160,9
80,What's going on?,JERRY,160,9
81,"Oh my God, the blood!",JERRY,160,9
82,"Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just doggin' it.",JERRY,160,9
83,What's the kid doing here?,JERRY,160,9
84,"Oh, that's a drag...",JERRY,160,9
85,You put blood in the car?!,JERRY,160,9
86,"Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you again.",JERRY,160,9
87,Then who?,JERRY,160,9
88,Aaaaahhh...!!!,JERRY,160,9
0,What are you doing?,GEORGE,160,9
1,"Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything I can do to lend support to the mood.",GEORGE,160,9
2,"Um, cream soda?",GEORGE,160,9
3,"I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there. We need some pudding here! Pudding!",GEORGE,160,9
4,I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another hour.,GEORGE,160,9
5,"I don't know, I was starving Jerry!",GEORGE,160,9
6,"Oh, pudding! You want some?",GEORGE,160,9
7,"What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it on the stove.",GEORGE,160,9
8,"So eh, what do you say?",GEORGE,160,9
9,"Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce, your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...",GEORGE,160,9
10,"Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie 9? weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?",GEORGE,160,9
11,"Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!",GEORGE,160,9
12,No.,GEORGE,160,9
13,"She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's only natural to combine them.",GEORGE,160,9
14,"Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.",GEORGE,160,9
15,"Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto knife.",GEORGE,160,9
16,"Well, I guess these would be out of the question. (pulls out two pudding skins in plastic bags.)",GEORGE,160,9
17,Pudding skin singles.,GEORGE,160,9
18,"Oh, Tara!",GEORGE,160,9
19,Three pints of Kramer's blood?,GEORGE,160,9
20,"Well, so much for purification week.",GEORGE,160,9
21,"Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that would really be the ultimate.",GEORGE,160,9
22,"She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on a baby-sitting gig.",GEORGE,160,9
23,"Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!",GEORGE,160,9
24,And now for the trifecta. (Picks up a hand held TV and gets back under the covers.),GEORGE,160,9
25,Pleasuring you?,GEORGE,160,9
26,I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.,GEORGE,160,9
27,I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.,GEORGE,160,9
28,I think you're right. You gonna eat that?,GEORGE,160,9
29,These fries are really really good...,GEORGE,160,9
30,"Uuh, sleepy.",GEORGE,160,9
31,Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.,GEORGE,160,9
32,"Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents in Redding Pennsylvania.",GEORGE,160,9
33,Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to Scotland.,GEORGE,160,9
34,"All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.",GEORGE,160,9
35,That's because it's underwater.,GEORGE,160,9
36,Is it?,GEORGE,160,9
37,"Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.",GEORGE,160,9
38,"Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?",GEORGE,160,9
39,Very.,GEORGE,160,9
40,Vivian!!,GEORGE,160,9
41,"Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.",GEORGE,160,9
42,Ouch!,GEORGE,160,9
43,I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't make it.,GEORGE,160,9
0,Yeah...,ELAINE,160,9
1,"I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got, you know all lurchy and awkward.",ELAINE,160,9
2,"Tomorrow evening, sure.",ELAINE,160,9
3,Do I know anyone??,ELAINE,160,9
4,"Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?",ELAINE,160,9
5,"I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.",ELAINE,160,9
6,You just left? What did you tell her?,ELAINE,160,9
7,I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.,ELAINE,160,9
8,"Hey, working out?",ELAINE,160,9
9,Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other someone.,ELAINE,160,9
10,No.,ELAINE,160,9
11,"Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...(hands the phone to Kramer.)",ELAINE,160,9
12,You? I'm more responsible than you are!,ELAINE,160,9
13,Kramer...,ELAINE,160,9
14,"It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here, I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.",ELAINE,160,9
15,"No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.",ELAINE,160,9
16,"Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help out...(Kramer moans from the bushes) what's that, some raccoon or something...(hits Kramer with a broom.)",ELAINE,160,9
17,Hi Jimmy. (Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.) Ouch! (The screen door hits her in the head.),ELAINE,160,9
18,I wish I was dead.,ELAINE,160,9
19,As long as you don't put...,ELAINE,160,9
20,Thanks for the re-fill.,ELAINE,160,9
21,"Oh, he's...he's a joy...",ELAINE,160,9
22,"Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.",ELAINE,160,9
23,"It's not serious, is it?",ELAINE,160,9
24,"Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. (Pours the juice from the bag back to glass.)",ELAINE,160,9
25,Hey.,ELAINE,160,9
26,"Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.",ELAINE,160,9
27,"It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.",ELAINE,160,9
28,"Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.",ELAINE,160,9
29,"I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you I'm no good watching that kid.",ELAINE,160,9
30,No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job or keep a man!,ELAINE,160,9
31,"All right, but I'm running out of purses here. (takes her purse from a punch ball.)",ELAINE,160,9
32,"Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.",ELAINE,160,9
33,"I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to Jimmy's birthday party.",ELAINE,160,9
34,"No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.",ELAINE,160,9
35,"Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.",ELAINE,160,9
36,Vivian...,ELAINE,160,9
37,Hi! This is my friend George.,ELAINE,160,9
38,I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.,ELAINE,160,9
39,(whispering to George) You're up.,ELAINE,160,9
40,So how long did they drag you?,ELAINE,160,9
41,Hi George. Hi Jimmy.,ELAINE,160,9
0,"Hey, Seinfelds!",KRAMER,160,9
1,How long are you staying?,KRAMER,160,9
2,"Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think. If he could go...",KRAMER,160,9
3,"No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank. Just in case.",KRAMER,160,9
4,"Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.",KRAMER,160,9
5,Done.,KRAMER,160,9
6,"My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood elsewhere, yeah.",KRAMER,160,9
7,"Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer with...my money!",KRAMER,160,9
8,"Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.",KRAMER,160,9
9,I closed down my account at the blood bank.,KRAMER,160,9
10,"Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?",KRAMER,160,9
11,"You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.",KRAMER,160,9
12,What the heck is going on here?,KRAMER,160,9
13,"Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.",KRAMER,160,9
14,"For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later. (puts the phone down) Well, somebody's baby-sitting.",KRAMER,160,9
15,"Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to fill my freezer with my own blood.",KRAMER,160,9
16,"Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.",KRAMER,160,9
17,Don't take my money!,KRAMER,160,9
18,"No, I'm the baby-sitter.",KRAMER,160,9
19,There was an incident.,KRAMER,160,9
20,Would you stop it.,KRAMER,160,9
21,It's Jell-O.,KRAMER,160,9
22,"This is tomato juice, look...(drinks from the bottle.)",KRAMER,160,9
23,Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He let me put it in his meat freezer.,KRAMER,160,9
24,"Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding skin singles. They're delicious.",KRAMER,160,9
25,Heads up!,KRAMER,160,9
26,"It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.",KRAMER,160,9

31,"Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood brother.",KRAMER,160,9
32,"What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, (takes Jerry hand) hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...",KRAMER,160,9

25,"Aye, aye.",JERRY,161,9
26,Hold on. There must be a truck backing up.,JERRY,161,9
27,"Great. You know, Frankie, I was wondering. What if I decided that it's silly to drive a van, because, you know, I live in New York City. Is there maybe some way I could exchange it?",JERRY,161,9

14,"Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to work for him.",GEORGE,163,9
15,What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.,GEORGE,163,9
16,"Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!",GEORGE,163,9
17,I am aware!,GEORGE,163,9
18,I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this guy can fix it up.,GEORGE,163,9
19,When are you going on your next date with her?,GEORGE,163,9
20,"What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that aloe pusher in her place?",GEORGE,163,9
21,"This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away working at the clinique counter!",GEORGE,163,9
22,"Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!",GEORGE,163,9
23,"No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go to a fancy dinner, flowers...",GEORGE,163,9
24,"Yeah, you gotta do it classy (wipes his mouth to his sweater.)",GEORGE,163,9
25,Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.,GEORGE,163,9
26,What is this? This is a drawing.,GEORGE,163,9
27,This is a cartoon!,GEORGE,163,9
28,"But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!",GEORGE,163,9
29,"I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo of Kruger.",GEORGE,163,9
30,Without his shirt on.,GEORGE,163,9
31,It seemed so disorganized.,GEORGE,163,9
32,"What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there, a lot of tradition.",GEORGE,163,9
33,I think.,GEORGE,163,9
34,Maybe I could be a land guy.,GEORGE,163,9
35,Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!,GEORGE,163,9
36,I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?,GEORGE,163,9
37,"Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?",GEORGE,163,9
38,"Yeah you did, you classed it up!",GEORGE,163,9
39,"Oh, so it backfired?",GEORGE,163,9
40,"So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.",GEORGE,163,9
41,"Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?",GEORGE,163,9
42,Could she do that at Kruger?,GEORGE,163,9
43,"So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click, I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.",GEORGE,163,9
44,"Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.",GEORGE,163,9
45,"And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..",GEORGE,163,9
46,"Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.",GEORGE,163,9
47,"I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted me to take a photograph for the record.",GEORGE,163,9
48,"His personal file, I, I don't ask...",GEORGE,163,9
49,"Jerry, what are you doing...",GEORGE,163,9
50,"Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!",GEORGE,163,9
51,"Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second. Be right with you.",GEORGE,163,9
52,"Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're a doctor and check this guy for moles.",GEORGE,163,9
53,"And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.",GEORGE,163,9
54,"Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...",GEORGE,163,9
55,"Kramer, I really owe you one.",GEORGE,163,9
56,What?,GEORGE,163,9
57,"So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone else.",GEORGE,163,9
58,"Because, you're not a dermatologist.",GEORGE,163,9
59,"Whoa, whoa, a section?!",GEORGE,163,9
60,"No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...",GEORGE,163,9
61,No! Absolutely Not!,GEORGE,163,9
62,"Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks to you.",GEORGE,163,9
63,Why don't you see someone about it?,GEORGE,163,9
64,You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.,GEORGE,163,9
65,"You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.",GEORGE,163,9
66,I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.,GEORGE,163,9
67,"Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.",GEORGE,163,9
68,"Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked out.",GEORGE,163,9
69,Whatever.,GEORGE,163,9
70,"Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo, until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out of there!",GEORGE,163,9
71,That's what they tell me!,GEORGE,163,9
72,"He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have you seen other dermatologist?",GEORGE,163,9
73,What did he give you for it.,GEORGE,163,9
74,Have to give him time on this hour.,GEORGE,163,9

12,"This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping since 3:30 this morning.",ELAINE,163,9
13,How do you do that?,ELAINE,163,9
14,"I know, I know, this is it. (points to a door.)",ELAINE,163,9

19,Are you okay?,ELAINE,163,9
20,The cat.,ELAINE,163,9
21,"Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've shut off the automatic feeder.",ELAINE,163,9
22,What did he do about it?,ELAINE,163,9
23,"Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.",ELAINE,163,9
24,"Yeah, how's the doctor date?",ELAINE,163,9

41,I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.,ELAINE,163,9
42,"Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer, okay? He has very strong feelings for it.",ELAINE,163,9
43,"Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists do.",ELAINE,163,9
44,Aha.,ELAINE,163,9
45,"I don't know, I guess.",ELAINE,163,9

59,"Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.",ELAINE,163,9
60,Can I have a zip? (Sticks a straw out from keyhole.),ELAINE,163,9

1,And to the bathroom.,KRAMER,163,9
2,"JERRY, GEORGE & KRAMER: Elaine, Elaine, Elaine, Elaine...(distant alarm sound which is getting louder.)",KRAMER,163,9
3,"Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?",KRAMER,163,9
4,"Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched the Statue of Liberty job.",KRAMER,163,9
5,You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple of days and get it air brushed.,KRAMER,163,9
6,You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in. Got that Ford right out of there.,KRAMER,163,9
7,"Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...",KRAMER,163,9
8,I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.,KRAMER,163,9
9,"Hey, our meat problems are solved.",KRAMER,163,9
10,"I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.",KRAMER,163,9
11,"Hey, spice. (gives Elaine a piece of meat.) Welcome to flavor country.",KRAMER,163,9
12,"You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.",KRAMER,163,9
13,"Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser rolls.",KRAMER,163,9
14,This hallway smells like potatoes.,KRAMER,163,9
15,"Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment. So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short out the entire circuit. Here you go...",KRAMER,163,9
16,"No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.",KRAMER,163,9
17,"Well, I don't want to either.",KRAMER,163,9

23,"You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.",KRAMER,163,9
24,"See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.",KRAMER,163,9
25,"Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.",KRAMER,163,9
26,"Oh, that's a prickly one.",KRAMER,163,9
27,"The slicer! Elaine, let's go.",KRAMER,163,9
28,The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.,KRAMER,163,9
29,I think we are looking half a millimeter.,KRAMER,163,9
30,"Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.",KRAMER,163,9
31,"Well, I guess I just assumed.",KRAMER,163,9
32,"Yeah, that's a hall of famer.",KRAMER,163,9
33,"Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...(Puts a slice of meat under the door.)",KRAMER,163,9
34,"Oh no, I don't think so.",KRAMER,163,9
35,"Well, you're not checked at on it.",KRAMER,163,9
36,"Well, where the meat goes?",KRAMER,163,9
37,Where do you turn it on?,KRAMER,163,9
38,But where does the meat go?,KRAMER,163,9
39,"Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.",KRAMER,163,9
40,"Ok, I'll go with you.",KRAMER,163,9
41,"Oh, well you have fun...(Elaine leaves) oh no clowns...hate clowns...the clowns.",KRAMER,163,9

45,"My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!",KRAMER,163,9
46,"Come on, this is important! (Shakes the door handle and it comes loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.)",KRAMER,163,9
47,"Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.",KRAMER,163,9
48,"So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing it out for me.",KRAMER,163,9
49,"Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing a fake beard?",KRAMER,163,9
50,"Well, what have you been doing?",KRAMER,163,9
51,"Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?",KRAMER,163,9
52,"There, there's your hives.",KRAMER,163,9
53,"Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.",KRAMER,163,9
54,"Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.",KRAMER,163,9
55,"Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.",KRAMER,163,9
56,He is just setting the record straight.,KRAMER,163,9
57,"Doc, huh?",KRAMER,163,9
58,"Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.",KRAMER,163,9
59,"You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?",KRAMER,163,9
60,"Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records. So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok, so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my on that.",KRAMER,163,9
61,"Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their own moles. Freckles that cover two men.",KRAMER,163,9
62,"Oh, so far, so good...(looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder) yeuye...",KRAMER,163,9
63,"George, we got a problem.",KRAMER,163,9
64,"Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.",KRAMER,163,9
65,"George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send him to another doctor?",KRAMER,163,9
66,He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what I wanna do; I think I can get a section...,KRAMER,163,9
67,"Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...",KRAMER,163,9
68,"It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.",KRAMER,163,9
69,"Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake. And it's going in my chart.",KRAMER,163,9
70,(Points to a page on the book) Squamous cell carcinoma.,KRAMER,163,9
71,"George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now we gotta came clean.",KRAMER,163,9

75,"Well, that's weird.",KRAMER,163,9
76,"Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.",KRAMER,163,9
77,"So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving you.",KRAMER,163,9
78,"Ohh, that's toxic. (Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.) Ououou....",KRAMER,163,9
79,Do you want more pastrami?,KRAMER,163,9
80,"Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?",KRAMER,163,9

3,I don't want to talk about it!,JERRY,164,9
4,'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.,JERRY,164,9

14,(Pleading) I'm really sorry.,JERRY,164,9
15,(Confused) Where'd you get that one?,JERRY,164,9
16,"That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly, I might add.",JERRY,164,9
17,How did he find out?,JERRY,164,9
18,You know you're not supposed to drink while you're keeping a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?,JERRY,164,9

52,Sure.,JERRY,164,9
53,"Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It never happened before.",JERRY,164,9
54,Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about this.. It'll crush him.,JERRY,164,9

61,I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never fooled around..,JERRY,164,9
62,Probably the reason..,JERRY,164,9

80,"If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in Nina and not lose a step.",JERRY,164,9
81,"Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the transition from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses... I need an awkward pause.",JERRY,164,9
82,Why?,JERRY,164,9
83,"So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?",JERRY,164,9
84,"Oh, I'm sure it's fine.",JERRY,164,9

2,This place is like Studio 54 with a menorah.,ELAINE,166,9
3,Oh.. (sees a guy looking at her) I got denim vest checking me out. (laughs) Fake phone number's coming out tonight.,ELAINE,166,9
4,Mm-hmm.,ELAINE,166,9
5,"(Holds onto Jerry's arm) No, please! Denim vest! He's smoothing it! Jerry! God! (Jerry excapes Elaine's grasp, moves over to the woman. The man wearing a denim vest moves over to Elaine.)",ELAINE,166,9
6,Nice vest. I like the.. big metal buttons,ELAINE,166,9

10,"I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub. 24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.",ELAINE,166,9
11,(Embarrassed) Free sub.,ELAINE,166,9
12,What?,ELAINE,166,9
13,"What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) ""Dear son, Happy Festivus."" What is Festivus?",ELAINE,166,9
14,Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.,ELAINE,166,9
15,"Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my ""Atomic Sub"" card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it when I gave it to denim vest!",ELAINE,166,9
16,"I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!",ELAINE,166,9
17,"Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish it.",ELAINE,166,9

22,What were your.. demands?,ELAINE,166,9
23,I believe that's the new minimum wage.,ELAINE,166,9
24,"So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard fake.",ELAINE,166,9

46,"No, no, no. You give me your number.",ELAINE,166,9
47,No.,ELAINE,166,9

53,"(To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?",ELAINE,166,9

4,"Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.",KRAMER,166,9
5,"Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.",KRAMER,166,9
6,"Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got to go. (Heads for the door)",KRAMER,166,9

8,"All right, everybody! I'm back!",KRAMER,166,9
9,Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.,KRAMER,166,9
10,Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?,KRAMER,166,9
11,"Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..",KRAMER,166,9
12,"Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full of bagels.) What are those?",KRAMER,166,9
13,"(Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live to see that..",KRAMER,166,9
14,"Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!",KRAMER,166,9
15,"Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel) It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.",KRAMER,166,9
16,"No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch them. (Jerry and George stop eating) Oh, we try to fool them by putting a few fresh ones on top, but they dig.. they, they test.",KRAMER,166,9
17,What's Festivus?,KRAMER,166,9
18,Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!,KRAMER,166,9
19,"Well, just tell me everything, huh?",KRAMER,166,9
20,What happened to the doll?,KRAMER,166,9
21,That musta been some kind of doll.,KRAMER,166,9
22,Is there a tree?,KRAMER,166,9
23,"Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right where I itch.",KRAMER,166,9
24,"No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the 23rd off.",KRAMER,166,9
25,But it's Festivus.,KRAMER,166,9
26,You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new holidays..,KRAMER,166,9
27,"Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike. Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's a walk out!",KRAMER,166,9
28,What? You're siding with management?!,KRAMER,166,9
29,(Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!,KRAMER,166,9
30,"Well, Happy Festivus.",KRAMER,166,9
31,There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's invited.,KRAMER,166,9
32,"(Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.",KRAMER,166,9
33,"Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels, (Continues to chant)",KRAMER,166,9
34,"(From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night. It's going down.",KRAMER,166,9
35,You've been warned.,KRAMER,166,9
36,Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!,KRAMER,166,9
37,(Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright night!,KRAMER,166,9
38,And?,KRAMER,166,9
39,Yeah.,KRAMER,166,9
40,"Oh, hello.",KRAMER,166,9
41,Ah-huh.,KRAMER,166,9
42,"Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and like, a foot taller.",KRAMER,166,9
43,"Oh, he's a tomcat.",KRAMER,166,9
44,"Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps up and down) Hee, hee, hee!",KRAMER,166,9
45,(Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see you.. It's a Festivus miracle!,KRAMER,166,9
46,Uh.. that's right.,KRAMER,166,9
47,Another Festivus miracle!,KRAMER,166,9
48,"Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to work a double shift at H&H.",KRAMER,166,9
49,"Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom. Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series of noises) out there.",KRAMER,166,9
50,"Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)",KRAMER,166,9
0,"Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..",JERRY,167,9
1,I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.,JERRY,167,9
2,"What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner. That was a cool one.",JERRY,167,9
3,"Well, what do you think the big holdup is?",JERRY,167,9
4,"Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?",JERRY,167,9
5,It's like we're living in the '50s here.,JERRY,167,9
6,"(To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car. (Gestures to a black Saab)",JERRY,167,9
7,(Gestures to his forehead) Youre getting that vein again.,JERRY,167,9
8,"(Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.",JERRY,167,9
9,I guess he graduated.,JERRY,167,9
10,(To Kramer) Thank you.,JERRY,167,9
11,All right. Calm down.,JERRY,167,9
12,"(To Kramer) All right, were goin in.",JERRY,167,9
13,"(Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just waiting for David Puddy.",JERRY,167,9
14,Hey.,JERRY,167,9
15,Ah. Whered you go?,JERRY,167,9
16,"So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900 convertible.",JERRY,167,9
17,"(As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.",JERRY,167,9
18,"So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more ""grease monkey"".",JERRY,167,9
19,"Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..",JERRY,167,9
20,I saw one once that could do sign language.,JERRY,167,9
21,"Yeah, Koko.",JERRY,167,9
22,No. We both just saw the same monkey.,JERRY,167,9
23,(Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?,JERRY,167,9
24,"Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed an annoying little habit?",JERRY,167,9
25,No.,JERRY,167,9
26,No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.,JERRY,167,9
27,"Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual. In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre doing sign language now.",JERRY,167,9
28,What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.,JERRY,167,9
29,"(Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s, and its still relatable today.",JERRY,167,9
30,(Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the machine) I think the candy comes out over there.,JERRY,167,9
31,"Either that, or theyve got a weird little hang-up about lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?",JERRY,167,9
32,How much was under there?,JERRY,167,9
33,"(While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands him a nickel)",JERRY,167,9
34,"Hey, can I have my dollar back?",JERRY,167,9
35,(Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you?,JERRY,167,9
36,Did you two break up?,JERRY,167,9
37,"""Rust-proofing""?",JERRY,167,9
38,"""Finders fee""? It was on the lot!",JERRY,167,9
39,Keys?!,JERRY,167,9
40,"Hey, George!",JERRY,167,9
41,"No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular customer, now!",JERRY,167,9
42,"(Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you want to play hard ball, I got my friend, George, here, and he can play pretty hard ball. (Leaving the negotiation to George) George, vein it up.",JERRY,167,9
43,"George! Can we focus on the car, here?",JERRY,167,9
44,Yellow? I wanted black.,JERRY,167,9
45,"(Pleading) George, would you help me, please?",JERRY,167,9
46,"Sing it, sister!",JERRY,167,9
47,"(Exasperated) Oh, God",JERRY,167,9
48,(To Puddy) Ill be right back.,JERRY,167,9
49,"Hey, George!",JERRY,167,9
50,"(Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow now!",JERRY,167,9
51,(Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!,JERRY,167,9
52,You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this deal.,JERRY,167,9
53,"Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands of dollars!",JERRY,167,9
54,"Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til my 15,000-mile check.",JERRY,167,9
55,Fine.,JERRY,167,9
56,No. No lunch.,JERRY,167,9
57,All right! Lunch!,JERRY,167,9
58,Bye. (Hangs up),JERRY,167,9
59,"(Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!",JERRY,167,9
60,"No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about the car.",JERRY,167,9
61,"Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. (All three sit down) Now, look, you both find each other attractive, right?",JERRY,167,9
62,"Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of you.",JERRY,167,9
63,"(Smiling, like a salesman) All right. Now, what do I have to do to put you two in a relationship today?",JERRY,167,9
64,"All right. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in principle: Arbys no more than once a month. And in exchange, Elaine comes to your softball game, and doesnt read a book.",JERRY,167,9
65,"So, youre back together?",JERRY,167,9
66,"All right, all right. All right, thats enough! Lets get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats a rip-off, isnt it, David?",JERRY,167,9
67,"So, Im gettin the insiders deal?",JERRY,167,9
68,"And where does it end? Then everyones doin it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase, ""Dont go there."" - Someones gotta take a stand!",JERRY,167,9
69,"And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic or the manager?",JERRY,167,9
70,I think theres a mental hospital near here.,JERRY,167,9
0,"When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?",GEORGE,167,9
1,"Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was right around the corner.",GEORGE,167,9
2,No. That's just electric.,GEORGE,167,9
3,"(Sarcastically) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang?",GEORGE,167,9
4,The government is very touchy about us being in the air. Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in the air is a big production.,GEORGE,167,9
5,And the underwater bubble cities?,GEORGE,167,9
6,Shhh What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know why you're here.,GEORGE,167,9
7,I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..,GEORGE,167,9
8,Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought he was a mechanic.,GEORGE,167,9
9,There's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back to screwin' you right to your face.,GEORGE,167,9
10,"Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptically) Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing, dealer prep. Suddenly, youre on your back like a turtle.",GEORGE,167,9
11,"My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All the kids are shoutin at me, ""Hey, Le George! Bonjour, Le George! Lets stuff Le George in Le Locker!""",GEORGE,167,9
12,"Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, ""Ill walk out of here right now!""",GEORGE,167,9
13,(Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!,GEORGE,167,9
14,(Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im doin here.,GEORGE,167,9
15,"(Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.",GEORGE,167,9
16,Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you use to soften people up?,GEORGE,167,9
17,"(Getting up, he addresses Jerry) All right, remember: no rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.",GEORGE,167,9
18,Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves),GEORGE,167,9
19,"Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry) You didnt agree to anything, did ya?",GEORGE,167,9
20,"(Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were none left. Heh!",GEORGE,167,9
21,"(To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.",GEORGE,167,9
22,(Talking it) Im here helpin you.,GEORGE,167,9
23,"(On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want you to think.",GEORGE,167,9
24,Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.,GEORGE,167,9
25,"Ah, come on!",GEORGE,167,9
26,"Ah, excuse me. Do you have, uh, change of a dollar?",GEORGE,167,9
27,"Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?",GEORGE,167,9
28,"(Stopping him) Ah, excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet was open, I - I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice that you have several crisp dollar bills.",GEORGE,167,9
29,"(Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im very hungry.",GEORGE,167,9
30,"(Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho, ho. What I would do with you..",GEORGE,167,9
31,"People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre too lazy to pick it up.",GEORGE,167,9
32,The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like to be.,GEORGE,167,9
33,(Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me. I just need another nickel.,GEORGE,167,9
34,"Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling his big fish in!",GEORGE,167,9
35,(Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.,GEORGE,167,9
36,"(As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to pound the machine) Come on! Jump!",GEORGE,167,9
37,They did?,GEORGE,167,9
38,"As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely empty) Hey, its gone. Where is my Twix? (Quickly looks around. His sights fall on the window of a door labeled ""Employees Only"". The same mechanic from before is eating a candy bar) What?! That guys eatin it!",GEORGE,167,9
39,"Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine! He mustve bought one, and gotten both.",GEORGE,167,9
40,"No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I see you! That is my Twix! (The mechanic eats the last of the Twix, obviously to make George even more angered. It works) Oh, ha, ha! Ho, ho!",GEORGE,167,9
41,"Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling. And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie, and you never bothered to ask why, or seek out its rightful owner.",GEORGE,167,9
42,"Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. (The mechanic shoots him a look as if he cleary does think hes stupid) That was no 5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of your lip! Now, that-that-that is a cookie - and we all know that Twix is the only candy bar with the cookie crunch.",GEORGE,167,9
43,Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in my life where I can tell the difference between nougat and cookie. So lets not just say things that we both know are obvious fabrications.,GEORGE,167,9
44,(Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I cant believe this guy..,GEORGE,167,9
45,"Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)",GEORGE,167,9
46,"I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No, ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres no laws in this place. Anything goes! Its Thunderdome!",GEORGE,167,9
47,"Stay back! (Runs out of the room, pushing Jerry out ahead of him)",GEORGE,167,9
48,"All right, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar. Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!",GEORGE,167,9
49,Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against my spine.,GEORGE,167,9
50,(Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!,GEORGE,167,9
51,Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch,GEORGE,167,9
52,"(Losing it) does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe, Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!",GEORGE,167,9
53,"Yes, Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.",GEORGE,167,9
54,"(To the man behind him in line) Yeah, right Im gonna get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just flush my money down the toilet?",GEORGE,167,9
55,"One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix candy bar!",GEORGE,167,9
56,"He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered in chocolate and cookie crumbs.",GEORGE,167,9
57,"Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.",GEORGE,167,9
58,"Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.",GEORGE,167,9

66,"Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue bar, as he claims, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem picking one out from a candy line-up?",GEORGE,167,9
67,Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars with no wrappers or identification of any kind for him to select from.,GEORGE,167,9
68,"Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities. And so, without further ado, I give you the candy line-up. (Opens a door to a back room. Various dealership employees are munching on candy bars)",GEORGE,167,9

5,"No, no, no, I didnt.",KRAMER,167,9

10,"Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?",KRAMER,167,9
11,"You know, Rick, oftentimes, Jerry - he lends me his car and I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas. But, for a variety of reasons, I dont want to be the one responsible for purchasing costly gasoline.",KRAMER,167,9
12,"(In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it up to him in other ways.",KRAMER,167,9
13,"Theres still some overlap between the needle and the slash below the ""E"".",KRAMER,167,9
14,"Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing. Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) put it out of your mind.",KRAMER,167,9
15,"Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont know who did it, and I never got to thank them..",KRAMER,167,9
16,Whoop! Whoop!,KRAMER,167,9

27,Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause it wont!,KRAMER,167,9
28,"Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership, and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone says, ""Kramer and that other guy, oh, they went further to the left of the slash than anyone ever dreamed!""",KRAMER,167,9
29,"Its good to have you back, Stan.",KRAMER,167,9
30,No time!,KRAMER,167,9
31,Hey!,KRAMER,167,9
32,"Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!",KRAMER,167,9

10,What?,JERRY,168,9
11,That's a five.,JERRY,168,9
12,Except the store's in Delaware.,JERRY,168,9
13,Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without this big wallet. It's more comfortable.,JERRY,168,9
14,Why?,JERRY,168,9
15,But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow here than here.,JERRY,168,9

29,"(talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.",JERRY,168,9
30,Because you threw it out.,JERRY,168,9
31,But you did actually throw his coat out the window.,JERRY,168,9
32,But that's you.,JERRY,168,9
33,Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing cabinet under half of your ass.,JERRY,168,9
34,What was that?,JERRY,168,9
35,All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.,JERRY,168,9
36,"No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?",JERRY,168,9

49,What is that noise?,JERRY,168,9
50,"You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being completely honest with me.",JERRY,168,9
51,What was that pop sound?,JERRY,168,9
52,It's European.,JERRY,168,9
53,"Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here. Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't he? So what was your job?",JERRY,168,9
54,"What, he doesn't like my taste in music?",JERRY,168,9

65,"No, you don't have to buy anything.",JERRY,168,9
66,I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?,JERRY,168,9
67,Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!,JERRY,168,9
68,Your good friend is morbidly obese.,JERRY,168,9

72,"Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite fur coat.",JERRY,168,9
73,It sure is.,JERRY,168,9
74,That's true.,JERRY,168,9
75,"Oh, thanks.",JERRY,168,9
76,Maybe this isn't my coat.,JERRY,168,9
77,"No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.",JERRY,168,9
78,Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!,JERRY,168,9
79,"The...black, leather...thing with a strap.",JERRY,168,9

83,Hello? Hello?,JERRY,168,9
0,And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?,GEORGE,168,9
1,"An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like one month off.",GEORGE,168,9

3,"Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.",GEORGE,168,9
4,I'll have 'em overnight it.,GEORGE,168,9
5,It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.,GEORGE,168,9

42,"Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.",GEORGE,168,9
43,"Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.",GEORGE,168,9
44,My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!,GEORGE,168,9

8,We never dated in winter.,ELAINE,168,9
9,"Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.",ELAINE,168,9
10,"I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you keep an eye on the ice, make sure we have enough?' Uh...",ELAINE,168,9
11,Why?,ELAINE,168,9
12,I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.,ELAINE,168,9

20,Oh. Uhhh...,ELAINE,168,9
21,So Joe Mayo had the same coat.,ELAINE,168,9
22,Mm-hmm.,ELAINE,168,9
23,So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.,ELAINE,168,9
24,"No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.",ELAINE,168,9
25,"But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.",ELAINE,168,9
26,"So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.",ELAINE,168,9
27,Look at you. You're on a slant.,ELAINE,168,9
28,"So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.",ELAINE,168,9
29,You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would be perfect for you.,ELAINE,168,9

34,Did he get it?,ELAINE,168,9
35,"Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.",ELAINE,168,9
36,"Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.",ELAINE,168,9
37,What are you talking about?,ELAINE,168,9
38,88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!,ELAINE,168,9
39,"Come in, come in.",ELAINE,168,9
40,"Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about something.",ELAINE,168,9
41,What?,ELAINE,168,9
42,"Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.",ELAINE,168,9
43,"You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.",ELAINE,168,9
44,"Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the only one who's held down a steady job for several years.",ELAINE,168,9
45,Ha ha ha ha.,ELAINE,168,9
46,"Uh, don't worry, he's cool.",ELAINE,168,9
47,"Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little favor, Newmie?",ELAINE,168,9

50,"Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.",ELAINE,168,9
51,"No, that's not your coat.",ELAINE,168,9
52,It's Joe Mayo's coat.,ELAINE,168,9
53,"Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with a sock full of pennies.",ELAINE,168,9
54,What is that?,ELAINE,168,9
55,You ditched the fur?,ELAINE,168,9
56,You're gonna wear this all the time?,ELAINE,168,9
0,Hey.,KRAMER,168,9
1,You got any pliers?,KRAMER,168,9
2,Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So you can see in.,KRAMER,168,9
3,"Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to jack me with a sock full of pennies.",KRAMER,168,9
4,"Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know, if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say, 'Enjoy the show.'",KRAMER,168,9
5,Mmm... Nice wallet.,KRAMER,168,9
6,"Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of cards and your bankroll. See, keep the big bills on the outside.",KRAMER,168,9
7,"I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...",KRAMER,168,9
8,"Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.",KRAMER,168,9

50,"I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.",KRAMER,168,9
51,"All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk. Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner, you pick up a paper, and you come right back.",KRAMER,168,9

25,(looking at the door) He's starin' at us.,GEORGE,170,9
26,Want a bite?,GEORGE,170,9
27,"(in his mind) I think that ginger ale at the coffee shop is just Coke and Sprite mixed together. How can I prove it? Ah! Can't, dammit. (knock at door. George goes to open it)",GEORGE,170,9
28,"(still by the door) What? M-Maura, what are you doin' here? I ended this relationship... twice!",GEORGE,170,9
29,Why does it always seem like I'm the only one working at this break-up?,GEORGE,170,9
30,(pauses to consider this then gives in) All right. (starts heading towards bedroom),GEORGE,170,9
31,(entering Monk's) Hey.,GEORGE,170,9
32,"(sitting down next to Jerry) Seeing Maura. Apparently, I was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.",GEORGE,170,9
33,"Who's this, Blue Arrow?",GEORGE,170,9
34,"Hey, Elaine. Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.",GEORGE,170,9
35,"Hey, maybe this cheating thing is what I could use to ditch Maura.",GEORGE,170,9
36,"She's like a district attorney. If it's not the truth, I'll break under the cross. I actually have to do it.",GEORGE,170,9
37,"Hey, you know, there's this secretary at work that always had a crush on me.",GEORGE,170,9
38,"She's too tanned. It's the middle of the winter, she's like a carrot.",GEORGE,170,9
39,"So, you... you say you've been in the city all winter?",GEORGE,170,9
40,Well... (shuts door) heeere we are (puts down his coat and chuckles),GEORGE,170,9
41,(excited) Ho ho! (gestures and steps towards bedroom but Loretta walks the other way to the couch),GEORGE,170,9

43,"Oh, not more building.",GEORGE,170,9
44,No?,GEORGE,170,9
45,"(after hesitating, resignedly) All right. (He sits down and smiles unconvincingly at her)",GEORGE,170,9
46,This isn't going well.,GEORGE,170,9
47,"You don't need the cufflinks! You have the same name! (no reaction) 'Jerry'! (heads for door, grabbing his coat)",GEORGE,170,9
48,"(opening door) It's a big night. I'm, uh, ice skating with one, and going to a staged reading of ""Godspell"" with the other.",GEORGE,170,9
49,"(shaking his head, weary) It doesn't matter. (he leaves)",GEORGE,170,9
50,"The, uh, actor that played Jesus made some odd choices.",GEORGE,170,9
51,"I mean, uh... I had fun ice skating.",GEORGE,170,9
52,"Maura. (starts acting dramatically, looking from Maura to Loretta and back again) Oh, my God! What are you doing here?!",GEORGE,170,9
53,"(standing up, still acting) Uhh! I'm caught in my own web of lies! (holds his hands up in surrender)",GEORGE,170,9
54,"(laughs hysterically, gesticulating wildly) This is all blowing up in my face! My serious girlfriend, and my torrid love affair have accidentally crossed paths. I have ruined three lives...

55,"(astounded) What? So, this is still not over?",GEORGE,170,9
56,You?,GEORGE,170,9
57,All right. (throws his coat back down on the seat and sits down opposite them),GEORGE,170,9
58,All right. I'm gonna try givin' them fifty-five dollars each... (to Elaine) What do you think?,GEORGE,170,9
59,"So, what's in the cooler? (flips open the lid)",GEORGE,170,9
0,"Right, right. I mean, if I was getting the chair, I'd go for something... hot and spicy, you know... Thai, maybe Mexican. Lethal injection, feels like pasta... you know, painless, don't want anything too heavy...",ELAINE,170,9
1,"Oh, sure! Why don't you give me your number?",ELAINE,170,9
2,Oh. OK. Maybe we could grab some lunch sometime. D-do you work around here or-?,ELAINE,170,9
3,"So, is there anything you can tell me about yourself?",ELAINE,170,9
4,(flattered) Oh (laughs) That'll do! (laughs some more),ELAINE,170,9
5,"I haven't talked to him in, like, three weeks... I THINK it might be over...",ELAINE,170,9
6,"I don't know. He wouldn't tell me his phone number, where he worked... I'll bet he's in a relationship.",ELAINE,170,9
7,Which one is he?,ELAINE,170,9
8,I don't care for jewellery on men (wags her finger disapprovingly),ELAINE,170,9
9,And... what would those be?,ELAINE,170,9
10,Literally.,ELAINE,170,9
11,Oh!,ELAINE,170,9
12,"Hey, what if he's married?",ELAINE,170,9
13,"No, the Green Lantern.",ELAINE,170,9
14,"Well, I don't know. I may never marry. It might be the closest I get.",ELAINE,170,9
15,"So, how is a guy like you not involved?",ELAINE,170,9
16,"(in her mind) That's true, maybe he's not married.",ELAINE,170,9
17,"Oh, that is so sweet.",ELAINE,170,9
18,"(in her mind, cynical) How long do I have to hold this?",ELAINE,170,9
19,Who is it?,ELAINE,170,9
20,"(in her mind) Married. That's it, I'm chucking the flower. (she does)",ELAINE,170,9
21,(shouting up) Jerry! Jerry!,ELAINE,170,9
22,You didn't hear me buzzing?,ELAINE,170,9
23,Throw down your key.,ELAINE,170,9
24,I'll catch it!,ELAINE,170,9
25,"...Yeah, you're right. Well, will you at least keep me company until somebody comes out?",ELAINE,170,9
26,Huh?,ELAINE,170,9
27,"Nodding off!... Well, I was right. He's an adulterer. And he's cheating on his wife with me!",ELAINE,170,9
28,(from the street) It went in the sewer! (Jerry reacts),ELAINE,170,9
29,"Yeah, flirted with the menu guy. Here. (hands him a large stack of papers)",ELAINE,170,9
30,Uh...,ELAINE,170,9
31,"Well, he could be a superhero! You should've seen him run.",ELAINE,170,9
32,"So, this is your little... love nest? (laughs)",ELAINE,170,9
33,Oh.,ELAINE,170,9
34,"Oh, that sounds... romantic.",ELAINE,170,9
35,"(in her mind, anguished) This is wrong. I should go. (There's a knock at the door)",ELAINE,170,9
36,"Oh, sure.",ELAINE,170,9
37,"(guiltily) Ah... You're the woman from the street, and I am so sorry. You know, I'm not really a home-wrecker. I-I-I-I-I thought he was a superhero. I swear.",ELAINE,170,9
38,This is his home?,ELAINE,170,9
39,"So, he's...",ELAINE,170,9
40,He wouldn't give me his number because he doesn't have a phone. (unwrapping a lollipop) He's not married. He's poor. (puts lollipop in her mouth),ELAINE,170,9
41,He probably busted it up and burned it for heat.,ELAINE,170,9
42,How can I end it over money? I feel bad.,ELAINE,170,9
43,Yes. There was this homeless guy who used to urinate on our garbage cans.,ELAINE,170,9
44,"Well, we gave him a few bucks, and... now he goes in the alley across the street.",ELAINE,170,9
45,"Well, I am NOT paying Glenn off to get out of this relationship. Wh-what am I supposed to do, just walk into his hovel, and hand him... well, how much do you think it would be?",ELAINE,170,9
46,"If only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know, things would have been so much simpler.",ELAINE,170,9
47,Green Lantern.,ELAINE,170,9
48,(not amused) All right.,ELAINE,170,9
49,(annoyed) We get it. (George is laughing),ELAINE,170,9
50,Thank you. (gets up from her seat),ELAINE,170,9
51,"(leaning over to George) Ooh, (fake laugh) well crafted. (exits)",ELAINE,170,9
52,(coming back into Monk's) Did I leave my glasses here?,ELAINE,170,9
53,(leaving again) Keep 'em! (George and Jerry savour the joke),ELAINE,170,9
54,"So, uh, what are we doing in this alley, anyway?",ELAINE,170,9
55,(giggling) Oh.,ELAINE,170,9
56,What are you doing? What is that?,ELAINE,170,9
57,It's garbage.,ELAINE,170,9
58,"(has had enough) All right, that's it. (rummaging in purse, pulls out her chequebook) How do you spell your last name?",ELAINE,170,9
59,(writing out cheque) I'll make it out to cash. How 'bout two hundred bucks? Two-fifty?,ELAINE,170,9
60,Make it three hundred.,ELAINE,170,9
61,"(touched, she takes it) Aw, Glenn.",ELAINE,170,9
62,"Yeah, and I got you a cord of wood, so you won't have to burn 'em.",ELAINE,170,9
63,Who is this?,ELAINE,170,9
64,You're... poor AND married?,ELAINE,170,9
65,I guess I'm... Lois Loan.,ELAINE,170,9
66,"Give me forty, you'll never see me again.",ELAINE,170,9
67,"(to Jerry) So, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna live here, or are you gonna move out, or what?",ELAINE,170,9
0,Hey. It happened again. (puts box on counter) Another robbery in the building.,KRAMER,170,9
1,"No, it's a strongbox to protect my irreplaceables.",KRAMER,170,9
2,"Some taxidermy that's been in my family for generations, my Tony, my... military discharge.",KRAMER,170,9
3,"Y- B-briefly. Now, I gotta find a good place to hide this key. Because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions. (makes a clicking sound)",KRAMER,170,9
4,"(offended) 'Literally'? What's THAT supposed to mean? (then to Jerry, before Elaine can answer) You mind if I hide this somewhere?",KRAMER,170,9
5,"(stuttering gibberish, gestures that they should leave) A little... privacy, uh?",KRAMER,170,9
6,"Come on, Jerry, this is a security issue! (Elaine laughs) Boy, you wouldn't last a DAY in the Army.",KRAMER,170,9
7,"Well, that's classified.",KRAMER,170,9
8,(from inside) OK!,KRAMER,170,9
9,(bangs arm of couch in frustration) You peeked!,KRAMER,170,9
10,It was under a spoon!,KRAMER,170,9
11,(re buzzer box) What are you doin'?,KRAMER,170,9
12,"(grabbing the key) You just had to go lookin' for it, didn't you? See, you hate it that I have a little secret. Anything I do -- oooh, oooh! -- you gotta know all about it. You're so OBSESSED with me.",KRAMER,170,9
13,"Oo, y- what are you doing with her? (Jerry ignores him and exits)",KRAMER,170,9
14,(from inside) Security issue!,KRAMER,170,9
15,(clattering inside) That wasn't me!,KRAMER,170,9
16,(from inside Jerry's apartment) OK! (door opens),KRAMER,170,9
17,"All right, Jerry. Let's see if you can get it in your head that this is not an Easter egg hunt for your childish amusement. (shuts door)",KRAMER,170,9
18,Heyyyy! (bangs the table in frustration and grabs the key),KRAMER,170,9
19,Heh.,KRAMER,170,9
20,It's Phil's.,KRAMER,170,9
21,"Our neighbor that you... turned against. (Jerry reacts) Anyway, I told him it'd be fine with us if he wanted to let it stretch its wings out in the hallway.",KRAMER,170,9
22,"Because since you've been playing God with the front door, I've been tryin' to smooth things out, Jerry. In fact, I was just hanging out at his place.",KRAMER,170,9
23,"Well, I don't know, but the key problem is solved. I hid it at Phil's...",KRAMER,170,9
24,"No, he doesn't know. See, I hid it without tellin' him. So, uh, (starts walking towards door) Phil won't be compulsively looking for it like some people... You! (points at Jerry)",KRAMER,170,9
25,"(entering Jerry's apartment, in his own tuxedo) Whoo! Boy. Yeah, you clean up nice.",KRAMER,170,9
26,"Yeah, see? I knew you would lose 'em. That's why I took 'em out of your dresser drawer and put 'em in my strongbox.",KRAMER,170,9
27,"Yeah, we'll stop by Phil's, we'll pick up the key, uh?",KRAMER,170,9
28,"Hey, what's going on?",KRAMER,170,9
29,"Yeah. Just give it to the Portuguese guy, and he... puts it in the incinerator.",KRAMER,170,9
30,"Yeah, yeah. (goes to Phil's door) You know, it's a... it's a funny thing about that bird dying. I hid the key in Fredo's food dish. Whoo! That's a weeeird coincidence.",KRAMER,170,9
31,What?,KRAMER,170,9
32,"(high-pitched) Well, Fredo was weak and stupid! He shouldn't have eaten that key!",KRAMER,170,9
33,You just answered your own question.,KRAMER,170,9
34,"(nodding) I'll get the shovel. (walks towards his apartment, as Jerry grimaces at the prospect)",KRAMER,170,9
35,"(reading a tombstone) 'Man's best friend'. Jerry, I want something like that on my tombstone.",KRAMER,170,9
36,"(sighs) All right, then you're the one getting the key out of him.",KRAMER,170,9
37,"Listen, I heard that Lassie #3 is buried around here. I'm gonna go check it out.",KRAMER,170,9
38,"Oh. Well, would you look at that. (puts a gun-shaped hand to his head and goes 'Pop') I guess I forgot to lock it.",KRAMER,170,9
39,"Well, this is one for the books, huh, Jerry?... Reeeally one for the books!",KRAMER,170,9
0,It's a Wizard electronic organizer for my dad. I'm goin' to Florida for his birthday.,JERRY,171,9
1,Two hundred. But I'll tell him it's fifty. He doesn't care about the gift. He gets excited about the deal.,JERRY,171,9
2,"Ah, I'll tell him I got it on the street, and maybe it's hot. That's his favorite.",JERRY,171,9
3,Susan's parents? When's the last time you talked to them?,JERRY,171,9
4,"Why, because you picked out the poision envelopes? That's silly.",JERRY,171,9
5,Still no Puddy?,JERRY,171,9
6,What? About you datin' a black guy? What's the big deal?,JERRY,171,9

51,"(in his parent's condo, to his father, who's in another room) Hey, Dad. You know you can program this thing to beep every time you need to take a vitamin. (as Kramer comes walking out in a retirement-like athletic sweatsuit) Dad, you look so different.",JERRY,171,9
52,"You know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.",JERRY,171,9

45,Yes. Thank you! Is that so hard?,GEORGE,171,9

21,Is that the right word?,ELAINE,171,9
22,Yeah.,ELAINE,171,9
23,"(starting to leave) You know what, I'm leavin'.",ELAINE,171,9

58,I am?,ELAINE,171,9
59,No. Why would you think that?,ELAINE,171,9

61,I don't think we should be talking about this.,ELAINE,171,9
62,I'm white.,ELAINE,171,9
63,I guess.,ELAINE,171,9

12,(Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.,KRAMER,173,9
13,(Brainstorming) What about the homeless?,KRAMER,173,9
14,(Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.,KRAMER,173,9
15,They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap something to them?!,KRAMER,173,9
16,"Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for are motivated, hard-working, homeless gentlemen like yourselves to pull rickshaws. (One of the homeless men starts to wander off, walking away) Now, I don't caer where you're from, or how you got here, or what happened to your homes. But you will have to be physically fit.",KRAMER,173,9
17,(Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned upper body.,KRAMER,173,9
18,"(To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No offence.",KRAMER,173,9
19,(Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good form.,KRAMER,173,9

29,"(Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.",KRAMER,173,9
30,What?,KRAMER,173,9
31,"Yes, that's true.",KRAMER,173,9
32,"Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme) One spot, two spot, zig, zag, tear, pop-die, pennygot, tennyum, tear, harum, scare 'em, rip 'em, tear 'em, tay, taw, toe..",KRAMER,173,9
33,"Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme again) One spot, two spot..",KRAMER,173,9
34,"(Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets the rickshaw down - taking a rest)",KRAMER,173,9

12,What?,GEORGE,174,9
13,You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with that score!,GEORGE,174,9

2,It's his birthday and it's his last day?,ELAINE,174,9
3,"All right, pile it on.",ELAINE,174,9
4,"It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?",ELAINE,174,9
5,"I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people. By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.",ELAINE,174,9

12,"What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy. Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!",ELAINE,174,9
13,So how's it going with my friend?,ELAINE,174,9
14,"Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.",ELAINE,174,9

101,"Alright, I'll feel him out.",JERRY,179,9
102,Another one?,JERRY,179,9
103,"Well, there goes the money for the lipo.",JERRY,179,9
104,"That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.",JERRY,179,9
105,"Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.",JERRY,179,9
106,"No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat in Sticksville.",JERRY,179,9
107,Under arrest? What for?,JERRY,179,9
108,"Oh, yeah.",JERRY,179,9
109,But then we would have missed the whole thing.,JERRY,179,9
110,I forgot about the video.,JERRY,179,9
111,Plane's ready.,JERRY,179,9
112,"You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.",JERRY,179,9
113,It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.,JERRY,179,9
114,Good morning.,JERRY,179,9
115,No.,JERRY,179,9
116,This one?,JERRY,179,9

120,Gimme that rye.,JERRY,179,9
121,I want that rye lady.,JERRY,179,9
122,"Shut up, you old bag!",JERRY,179,9
123,The virgin!,JERRY,179,9
124,Who the hell is that?,JERRY,179,9
125,"That's right, the Bubble Boy.",JERRY,179,9
126,He's a boy who lives in a bubble.,JERRY,179,9
127,Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.,JERRY,179,9
128,Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.,JERRY,179,9
129,Who?,JERRY,179,9
130,Medium crab bisque.,JERRY,179,9
131,Just forget it. Let it go.,JERRY,179,9
132,How did they find Babu?,JERRY,179,9
133,Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?,JERRY,179,9
134,It's not that bright orange one is it?,JERRY,179,9
135,"Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was going down?",JERRY,179,9
136,Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.,JERRY,179,9
137,What?,JERRY,179,9
138,"Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then we'll be back",JERRY,179,9
139,Sure.,JERRY,179,9
140,I think that would be a very nice gesture.,JERRY,179,9
141,"See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.",JERRY,179,9
142,"Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the shirt. Look at it, it's too high, it's in no-man's land.",JERRY,179,9
143,You think?,JERRY,179,9
144,"Yeah, maybe we have.",JERRY,179,9
145,"So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me to play in the yard. But of course she didn't have to worry about my next door neighbor Tommy sticking a shiv in my thigh. And what's with the lockdown? Why do we have to be locked in our cells? Are we that bad that we have to be sent to prison, in prison? You would think the weightlifting and the sodomy is enough. So, anyone from Cellblock D?",JERRY,179,9
146,"I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?",JERRY,179,9

150,"Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.",JERRY,179,9
0,"I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would that be a terrible thing? ""How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for you?""",GEORGE,179,9
1,Do ya?,GEORGE,179,9
2,Same thing!,GEORGE,179,9
3,Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?,GEORGE,179,9
4,Nah - what for?,GEORGE,179,9
5,I've been to the movies.,GEORGE,179,9
6,"They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of it.",GEORGE,179,9
7,Yeah.,GEORGE,179,9
8,"When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my 15 minutes!",GEORGE,179,9
9,Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it for me anymore. I'm sick of health.,GEORGE,179,9
10,"Oh, very gracious.",GEORGE,179,9
11,Yeah.,GEORGE,179,9
12,What are you crazy?,GEORGE,179,9
13,Big hefty stinking faux pas.,GEORGE,179,9
14,On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.,GEORGE,179,9
15,It's dismissive.,GEORGE,179,9
16,Why don't you think before you do something?,GEORGE,179,9
17,Too much?,GEORGE,179,9
18,Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should know better than that.,GEORGE,179,9
19,What?,GEORGE,179,9
20,You're so uptight.,GEORGE,179,9
21,Who's he?,GEORGE,179,9
22,"Our show, ""Jerry""?",GEORGE,179,9
23,"""Jerry"", oh my God. He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?",GEORGE,179,9
24,When?,GEORGE,179,9

26,"He wants to talk about ""Jerry""?",GEORGE,179,9
27,"""Jerry""!",GEORGE,179,9
28,Can I go like this?,GEORGE,179,9
29,No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.,GEORGE,179,9
30,I won't feel like a writer.,GEORGE,179,9

46,Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp - it's crispy crisp.,GEORGE,179,9
47,What do we have in the fruit department?,GEORGE,179,9
48,"Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the end. You can get killed from one of those things.",GEORGE,179,9
49,"Been there, done that.",GEORGE,179,9
50,Water coolers?,GEORGE,179,9
51,"See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.",GEORGE,179,9
52,It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use bottles.,GEORGE,179,9
53,"I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show is all about.",GEORGE,179,9
54,Or we could get them together. Woo!,GEORGE,179,9
55,Yeah!,GEORGE,179,9
56,I'm moving to California.,GEORGE,179,9
57,Of course he liked it.,GEORGE,179,9

67,Me too.,GEORGE,179,9
68,This is it?,GEORGE,179,9
69,"I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a lot nicer.",GEORGE,179,9
70,You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?,GEORGE,179,9
71,"Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.",GEORGE,179,9
72,This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.,GEORGE,179,9
73,Why?,GEORGE,179,9
74,It's effeminate to sit like this?,GEORGE,179,9
75,How is this effeminate?,GEORGE,179,9
76,"Kramer, what are you doing?",GEORGE,179,9
77,Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.,GEORGE,179,9
78,"Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.",GEORGE,179,9
79,Kramer!,GEORGE,179,9
80,Oh my God!,GEORGE,179,9

83,Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?,GEORGE,179,9
84,There's something I have to tell you.,GEORGE,179,9
85,I cheated in the contest.,GEORGE,179,9

88,Hey - What's going on?,GEORGE,179,9
89,We're straightening out!,GEORGE,179,9
90,I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.,GEORGE,179,9
91,"First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough, tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the good one - the Ted Danson plane.",GEORGE,179,9
92,"Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.",GEORGE,179,9
93,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,GEORGE,179,9
94,I never heard of that.,GEORGE,179,9
95,Why would we want to help somebody?,GEORGE,179,9
96,That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.,GEORGE,179,9
97,"All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and get the hell out of here.",GEORGE,179,9
98,Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV show.,GEORGE,179,9
99,"Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.",GEORGE,179,9
100,"Yeah, he's right.",GEORGE,179,9
101,It makes me look older.,GEORGE,179,9
102,Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?,GEORGE,179,9
103,"Jerry, did you hear that?",GEORGE,179,9
104,I think that's a good sign.,GEORGE,179,9
105,He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.,GEORGE,179,9
106,Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us killed!,GEORGE,179,9
107,The Bubble Boy!,GEORGE,179,9

22,"All right! You know what, just forget it!",ELAINE,179,9
23,I'll go to Paris.,ELAINE,179,9

27,Wow!,ELAINE,179,9
28,Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.,ELAINE,179,9
29,Will you turn around?,ELAINE,179,9
30,You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.,ELAINE,179,9

12,Fling!,KRAMER,179,9
13,I say Japan.,KRAMER,179,9
14,"Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine art of fishing - or baking.",KRAMER,179,9
15,"Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?",KRAMER,179,9
16,Oh yeah - oui oui.,KRAMER,179,9
17,The only way to fly.,KRAMER,179,9

19,"I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.",KRAMER,179,9
20,I lost my balance.,KRAMER,179,9

33,"Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.",KRAMER,179,9
34,Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about when he asked that cop if a black man had ever been to his house. Did you see the look on his face?,KRAMER,179,9
35,I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.,KRAMER,179,9
36,"Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe ""Bye Bye Birdie"" or ""My Fair Lady"". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.",KRAMER,179,9
